            <H3>Lesson 2: If statements</H3>The if statement is one of the most 
            powerful devices in programming. It allows the program to choose an 
            action based upon input. For example, a program can be written to 
            decide if a user can access the program by using an if statement to 
            check if the password is correct or not.<BR><BR>Without a 
            conditional statement such as if programs would run almost the exact 
            same way every time. If statements allow the flow of the program to 
            be changed.<BR><BR>Please note that all Boolean operators or values 
            will be capitalized to differentiate them from normal English. Note, 
            as well, that the actual C++ symbols to the operators are described 
            later, but the C++ symbols are not OR, NOT, and AND. The symbols 
            simply mean the same thing.<BR><BR>There are many things to 
            understand when using if statements. You must understand Boolean 
            operators such as OR, NOT, and AND. You must also understand 
            comparisons between numbers and most especially, the idea of true 
            and false in the same way computers do.<BR><BR>True and false in C++ 
            are denoted by a non-zero number, and zero. Therefore, 1 is TRUE and 
            8.3 is TRUE but 0 is FALSE. No other number is interpreted as being 
            false.<BR><BR>When programming, the program often will require the 
            checking of one value stored by a variable against another value, to 
            determine which is larger, smaller, or if the two are 
            equal.<BR><BR>To do so, there are a number of operators 
            used.<BR><BR>The relational operators, as they are known, along with 
            examples:<BR><PRE>&gt;     greater than              5&gt;4 is TRUE
&lt;     less than                 4&lt;5 is TRUE
&gt;=    greater than or equal     4&gt;=4 is TRUE
&lt;=    less than or equal        3&lt;=4 is TRUE
</PRE>It is highly probable that you have seen these before in some 
            mathematical manifestation, probably with slightly different 
            symbols. They should not present any hindrance understanding. 
            <BR>More interesting are the Boolean operators. They return 0 for 
            FALSE, and a nonzero number for TRUE. <BR><BR>NOT: This just says 
            that the program should reverse the value. For example, NOT (1) 
            would be 0. NOT (0) would be 1. NOT (any number but zero) would be 
            0. In C and C++ NOT is written as !. <BR><BR>AND: This is another 
            important command, it returns a one if 'this' AND 'this' are true. 
            (1) AND (0) would come out as 0 because both are not true, only 1 is 
            true. (1) AND (1) would come out as 1. (ANYREAL NUMBER BUT ZERO) AND 
            (0) would be 0. (ANY REAL NUMBER BUT ZERO) AND (ANY REAL NUMBER BUT 
            ZERO) would be 1. The AND is written as &amp;&amp; in C++. Do not be 
            confused and think that it checks equality between numbers. It does 
            not. Keep in mind that AND will be evaluated before OR.<BR><BR>OR: 
            Very useful is the OR statement! If either (or both) of the two 
            values it checks are TRUE then it returns TRUE. For example, (1) OR 
            (0) would be 1! (0)OR(0) would be0. (ANY REAL NUMBER) OR (ANY REAL 
            NUMBER BUT ZERO) would be 1! The OR is written as || in C++. Those 
            are the pipe characters. On your keyboard, they may look like a 
            stretched colon. On my computer it shares its key with \. Keep in 
            mind that OR will be evaluated after AND.<BR><BR>The next thing to 
            learn is to combine them... What is !(1 &amp;&amp; 0)? Of course, it 
            would be TRUE (1). This is because 1 &amp;&amp; 0 evaluates two 0 
            and ! 0 equals 1. <BR><BR>Try some of these...they are not hard. If 
            you have questions about them, you can email meat 
            lallain@concentric.net.<BR><PRE>	A. !(1 || 0)	       		ANSWER: 0	
        B. !(1 || 1 &amp;&amp; 0)    		ANSWER: 0 (AND is evaluated before OR)
    	C. !((1 || 0) &amp;&amp; 0)     	ANSWER: 1 (Parenthesis are useful)
</PRE>If you find you enjoy this you might want to look more at 
            Boolean Algebra, which is also very helpful to programmers as it is 
            useful for helping program conditional statements.<BR><BR>The 
            structure of an if statement is essentially:<BR><PRE>if (TRUE)
  Do whatever follows on the next line.
</PRE>To have more than one statement execute after an if statement 
            (when it evaluates to true) use brackets. <BR><BR>For example,<BR><PRE>if (TRUE)
{
  Do everything between the brackets.
}</PRE>There is also the else statement. The code after it (whether 
            a single line or code between brackets) is executed if the IF 
            statement is FALSE.<BR><BR>It can look like this:<BR><PRE>if(FALSE)
{ 
  Not executed if its false
}
else 
{
  do all of this
}
</PRE>One use for else is if there are two conditional statements 
            that will both evalueate to true with the same value(but only at 
            times. For example, x&lt;30 and x&lt;50 will both return true if x 
            is less than 30 but not otherwise), but you wish only one of them to 
            be checked. You can use else after the if statement. If the if 
            statement was true the else statement will not be checked. It is 
            possible to use numerous else statements followed by if 
            statements.<BR><BR>Let's look at a simple program for you to try out 
            on your own...<BR><PRE>#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;			
int main()				//Most important part of the program!
{
  int age;				//Need a variable...
  cout&lt;&lt;"Please input your age: ";	//Asks for age
  cin&gt;&gt;age;				//The input is put in age
  if(age&lt;100)				//If the age is less than 100
  {
     cout&lt;&lt;"You are pretty young!";     //Just to show it works
  }
  else if(age==100)		//I use else just to show an example 
  {
     cout&lt;&lt;"You are old";		//Just to show you it works...
  }
  else if(age&gt;100)
  {
    cout&lt;&lt;"You are really old";	//Proof that it works for any condition<BR>
  }
  return 0;
}
</PRE>This program did not use &amp;&amp; || ! or in it. This is 
            because it did not need too. Its purpose was to demonstrate if 
            statements. <BR></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><!-- Start SuperStats code version 3.0a. -->
