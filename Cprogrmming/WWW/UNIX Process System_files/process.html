<H3>Introduction</H3>A major feature of UNIX is that it can run multiple 
processes (each process has its own thread of control). This ability gives UNIX 
the title of a multi-tasking operating system. Each user can "own" multiple 
processes which operate with apparent concurrency. Of course where the machine 
has fewer processors than processes then the processes will have to be scheduled 
to share the processors so as create an illusion of concurrency. 
<P>Each process has a identifier called the process ID which is unique at any 
one time for one machine, the process also has a process group which is 
described <A 
href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Dept/Teaching/CourseNotes/current/CS23710/UNIX/notes/process/process.html#processgrp">later</A>. 

<P>A process is an executing program that has an area of memory (address space) 
in which it runs. Within the address space the program code, data values held as 
program variables, the program stack, hardware registers and a list of file 
descriptors are held. 
<P>A process's address space (memory) is protected from other processes. 
However, if a number of processes are executing the same program then only one 
copy of that program is stored in primary memory, and is accessed by all the 
processes that need it (see figure below). A process's address space consists of 
the following regions <A 
href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Dept/Teaching/CourseNotes/current/CS23710/UNIX/notes/references.html#BACH86">[BACH86]</A>. 

<OL>
  <LI>Text (or code) - reentrant code or unmodifiable data, sharable. 
  <LI>Data region - modifiable. 
  <LI>Stack region - Process stack. 
  <LI>Register contents, Process priority, list of open files. </LI></OL>
<P><IMG alt="Organization and sharing of process address space." 
src="process_files/process_model.art" align=middle border=1> 
<P>In the figure, two processes share part of the same text segment. Notice that 
we talk about virtual memory which is mapped onto real memory locations at the 
last moment during execution. Such virtual memory will also be mapped onto swap 
disk when pages of the process are swapped out of physical memory during process 
scheduling (so as to give another process a share of the memory). 
<HR>
<A name=scheduling></A>
<H3>Scheduling</H3>The UNIX scheduler, which is part of the kernel, manages 
processes using <I>round robin with multilevel feedback</I>. This means that it 
allocates the CPU to a process for a time quantum (time period) and pre-empts a 
process that exceeds its time quantum, placing it back onto one of several 
priority queues<A 
href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Dept/Teaching/CourseNotes/current/CS23710/UNIX/notes/references.html#BACH86">[BACH86]</A>. 

<P>The queues include: 
<UL>
  <LI>Ready to run and loaded in memory. 
  <LI>Pre-empted. These are processes that were running but were pre-empted by 
  the scheduler to give another process access to the CPU. 
  <LI>Swapped out. These are processes that have been swapped out of memory onto 
  swap disk. 
  <LI>Blocked ( sleeping) waiting for I/O. These are processes waiting for some 
  resource to become available (they are sent an interrupt). </LI></UL>
<P>Each process has a dynamic process priority. The kernel will pick the process 
with the highest priority. If there are several with the same top priority value 
then the kernel picks the process which has been waiting the longest on the 
<EM>ready to run</EM> queue. A process may need to iterate across the queues and 
processor many times before it completes. 
<P>Dynamic priority values are apportioned to processes by the scheduler based 
on three main criteria: 
<OL>
  <LI>The static base priority (-20 to +20), see <A 
  href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Dept/Teaching/CourseNotes/current/CS23710/UNIX/notes/process/process.html#priorities">below</A>. 

  <LI>A higher dynamic priority is given to processes that have used the least 
  processor time recently. This handicaps processor intensive processes. 
  <LI>The scheduler forgets 90% of the processor use history in <EM>5 * n</EM> 
  seconds. <EM>n</EM> is the average number of runnable processes over the last 
  minute (the average number of runnable processes on a typical workstation is 
  less than a typical server). For example, if there have been 12 processes 
  using the processor in the last minute then the processor will forget about 
  90% of these 12 processes during the following minute (5 * 12). </LI></OL>
<P>The practical effect of the scheduling algorithm is: 
<UL>
  <LI>Processor intensive processes are penalized when the system is under heavy 
  load. 
  <LI>CPU intensive processes have their sins forgotten. 
  <LI>I/O bound or interactive processes are favoured. 
  <LI>The system adjusts over time to the nature of a process load. </LI></UL>
<P>We came across mode switching in the <A 
href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Dept/Teaching/CourseNotes/current/CS23710/UNIX/notes/overview/overview.html#process">overview 
notes</A>. In that case a mode switch was between a process running in user mode 
or kernel mode. It also happens that the scheduler switches between processes 
(user and system) and this is termed a context switch. 
<P>When the kernel does a context switch it restores the context of a process so 
it can continue execution from the point at which it was suspended. This is the 
same type of operation as the context switch involved in a system call, when a 
process is switched from running in user mode to running in kernel mode, the 
same data has to be saved. Context switches present a substantial overhead to 
the performance of the operating system. 
<HR>
<A name=priorities></A>
<H3>Process priorities</H3>Each process has a static base priority of between 
-20 and +20, the default being 0. Perversely, the process priority increases as 
the priority value decreases (i.e. the highest priority value is -20)! This base 
priority helps the scheduler determine the dynamic priority (discussed earlier). 
This priority helps determine which process will get favoured treatment when 
competing with other processes for resources such as CPU time and I/O. The 
scheduler uses process priority to choose which process to run if all other 
attributes are equal. Only privileged processes (root) can run at a priority 
value of less than 0. The process priority is passed across calls to 
<EM>fork</EM> and <EM>exec</EM>. The scheduler, as you would expect, has the 
highest priority (-20). 
<P>The commands <EM>nice(1)</EM> and <EM>renice(8)</EM> can be used to initiate 
and reprioritize processes with alternative priorities. <PRE>void:cmk&gt; nice +10 ls - \ \ Runs ls at a lower priority
 
void:cmk&gt; renice -10 $$ - \ \ raise priority of the current process(the shell).
</PRE>
<P>Nice and renice are social services which can be used to make resource 
intensive processes more socially acceptable on multi-user, multi-tasking 
machines. A process with priority 19 will only run when no other process wishes 
to run. This is useful if you have a CPU intensive program which you leave 
running over a long period of time. If such a process has a low priority it will 
tend to be scheduled for execution only during off-peak periods. <PRE>nice [ -number ] command [ arguments ]
 
/usr/bin/renice priority pid...
</PRE>
<P>The priority of a process can be changed from within a program: <PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
int main()
{
   int x;
   nice(20);
 
   for (x = 0; x &lt; 200; x++)
      printf("me slow\n");
 
   nice(0);
 
   for (x = 0; x &lt; 200; x++)
      printf("me normal speed\n");
 
   if (nice(-20) == -1)     {
       fprintf(stdout,"I am not root, I can't do that\n");
       exit(1);
    }
  
    for (x = 0; x &lt; 200; x++)
      printf("me Road Runner!\n");

    return 0;
}
</PRE>
<P>On a lightly loaded machine no difference will be detected. On a heavily 
loaded machine the second loop has a much shorter execution time. Try it! 
<HR>
<A name=processgrp></A>
<H3>Process groups and process group IDs</H3>Processes may be placed in groups, 
each group is denoted by an integer - the process group id. The value of the 
group ID is returned by the <EM>getpgrp</EM> call. A process will inherit its 
initial group ID from its parent, but can be placed in a new group using 
<EM>setpgrp</EM>. <PRE>int getpgrp(nt pid);
int setpgrp(void);
</PRE>
<P>A call to <EM>setpgrp</EM> will make the calling process the group leader of 
a new process group returning the process new group ID. Any children will 
inherit this process group ID. Processes are terminated when their common 
ancestor dies which is determined on the basis of their process group ID. A 
process can change its process group to avoid dying when its parent is 
terminated. This allows processes to continue running after the user has logged 
out. This is useful for daemon processes such as biod and nfsd. Care should be 
taken not to leave process running for long periods when you are logged out; 
this is viewed as antisocial. 
<P>The following is an example of the use of <EM>setpgrp</EM> and 
<EM>getpgrp</EM> where the user provides the shell process id as a command line 
argument. <PRE>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

  /* fork creates a new child process. This is discussed in detail later */

<H3>Creating processes</H3>As shown in the <A 
href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Dept/Teaching/CourseNotes/current/CS23710/UNIX/notes/overview/overview.html#shell">overview 
notes</A> a new process is created by the shell each time a command is entered. 
Any process can create another process by using the <EM>fork</EM> system call. 
<HR>
<A name=fork></A>
<H4>Fork</H4>The <EM>fork</EM> call creates a new process which is an exact copy 
of the process that called <EM>fork</EM> (the parent); that is, it is running 
the same program. The new process is called the child, which has its own address 
space and is an exact copy of its parent. 
<P>The following program and diagram demonstrate the concept of a parent process 
running, then executing a fork, followed by both parent and child executing the 
same code which forms the remainder of the program. The child is an exact copy 
of the parent, so both the parent and child are running exactly the same code. 
The only difference between the parent and child is the value that fork returns. 

<P><IMG alt="Child parent relationship after a fork." 
src="process_files/child_parent.art" align=middle border=1> 
<P>The parent receives the process id of the child, whereas the child receives 
the value 0. <PRE>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(void)

     exit(1);
  }
     
  if (pid == 0)    {
     printf("I'm the child and my process id is %ld\n", getpid());
     printf("My parent's process id is %ld\n", getppid());

My parents process id is 11361
I am the parent and my process id is 11361
</PRE>
<P>Normally, as in a previous example, the parent would call <EM>wait</EM> to 
wait for the child to finish. 
<P>This feature can be used to make the parent and child execute a different set 
of instructions. In this example, the variable PID takes the value of the 
process ID returned from fork and is tested. If the value is 0, a message is 
printed concluding this is the child and the process ID is obtained from the 
<EM>getpid</EM> system call. If the value is greater then 0 (note the test for 
fork failing) then it is concluded to be the parent and the parent's process ID 
is obtained using <EM>getppid</EM>. When a process finishes it calls exit to 
close its file descriptors, deallocate resources and return a value to its 
parent. 
<P>The child inherits all data and file descriptors (and therefore open files) 
across a call to <EM>fork</EM>. 
<P><EM>fork</EM> allows us to do concurrent programming by enabling a number of 
processes to be initiated by one program and execute as separate tasks. Several 
potential problems may occur as a result of this: 
<UL>
  <LI>The parent, child and its peers reading and writing via the same file 
  descriptors, potentially corrupting each other's data. 
  <LI>The child process executing statements meant for the parent or vice versa. 

  <LI>The parent not waiting for the child to terminate. If a child exits and 
  there is no parent waiting for it, then it gets inherited by a special system 
  process called <EM>init</EM>. Such defunct child processes are morbidly known 
  as zombies! </LI></UL>

<A name=execl></A>
<H4>Execl</H4>The <EM>exec</EM> family of system calls are used to execute a new 
program from within a process by overlaying the new program onto the calling 
programs address space. The new program is started from its beginning and the 
old program is overwritten. <B>No</B> new process is created. A successful call 
to <EM>exec</EM> never returns since the calling program text gets obliterated 
by the called program text. <PRE>int execl(const char* path, const char* arg0 [ , arg1,...  , argn ] (char *)0);
 
int execv(const char* path, char *const argv[]);

int execvp(const char* file, char *const argv[]);
</PRE>
<P>We shall use <EM>execl</EM> as an example from this family of functions. See 
<EM>exec(2)</EM> for the differences between the calls. The following program 
takes an argument list provided by the calling process and executes the 
<EM>ls</EM> command with the given arguments. Note that the new program image 
inherits standard input, standard output and standard error. <PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<P>The environment of a process is passed across calls to <EM>fork</EM> and 
<EM>exec</EM>. The environment of a process can also be accessed via a global 
external variable called <EM>environ</EM>. It gives the same results exactly as 
the previous program. <PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
/* Print the environment of a program */
extern char **environ;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  while(*environ != (char *)0)
    printf("%s\n",*environ++);

  return 0;
}
</PRE>
<P>To access an individual field, instead of matching the variable name (HOME, 
USER for example) the <EM>getenv</EM> call can be used. To set a field 
<EM>putenv</EM> can be used. <PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* Print parts of the environment of a program */

<H3>User and group ID</H3>Every process has six important IDs. The process ID 
and process group ID were discussed <A 
href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Dept/Teaching/CourseNotes/current/CS23710/UNIX/notes/process/process.html#processgrp">earlier</A>. 
The other four important IDs were briefly discussed in the context of <A 
href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Dept/Teaching/CourseNotes/current/CS23710/UNIX/notes/filesystem/fs.html#permissions">file 
modes</A> where the IDs are used to judge which set of file access permissions 
apply to a process. The IDs are: 
<UL>
  <LI>Real user ID. 
  <LI>Real group ID. 
  <LI>Effective user ID. 
  <LI>Effective group ID. </LI></UL>
<P>The real UID and real group UID will be the same as the UID and GID of the 
user executing the program. Normally, the effective UID and effective GID are 
the same as their real counterparts. But, as you know, setting the set-uid and 
set-gid bits of an executable file changes this. In this situation the effective 
IDs are set the IDs of the owner and/or group of the executable file. This is 
important since, in most cases, it is the effective IDs which are used to 
determine if a process has sufficient access rights when accessing a UNIX 
resource (e.g. wants to write to a file). 
<P>A whole series of system calls are available for manipulating these IDs: <PRE>int getuid();
int geteuid();
 
int getgid();
int getegid();

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
 
int setuid(uid_t uid);
 
int seteuid(uid_t euid);
 
int setruid(uid_t ruid);
 
int setgid(gid_t gid);

int setegid(gid_t egid);
 
int setrgid(gid_t rgid);
 
int setreuid(int ruid, int euid);
 
int setregid(int rgid, int egid);
</PRE>
<UL>
  <LI>getuid - gets the real user ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>geteuid - gets the effective user ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>getgid - gets the real group ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>getegid - gets the effective group ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>setuid - sets both real and effective user ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>seteuid - set the effective user ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>setruid - set the real user ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>setreuid - set the real and effective user ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>setgid - sets both real and effective group ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>setegid - set the effective group ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>setrgid - set the real group ID of the calling process. 
  <LI>setregid - set the real and effective group ID of the calling process. 
  </LI></UL>
<P>A process that is not privileged (root) can only set the effective user and 
group IDs back to their real counterpart. Root processes can set these IDs to 
any value. 
<HR>
<A name=errors></A>
<H3>Errors - errno and sys_errlist</H3>When an error occurs a global variable 
called <EM>errno</EM>, which is unique to each process, is set to an integer 
value which represents which type of error occurred. The value of errno can be 
used to access an array of character strings called <EM>sys_errlist</EM> which 
gives the meaning of the error message. Each time a new error occurs, errno is 
set to the appropriate value for this error, and therefore no record is kept of 
its previous values. Intro(2) discusses the error codes in detail. 
<P><EM>perror</EM> produces a message on standard output describing the last 
error. You can append your own message to the end of this predefined message. <PRE>void perror(char* s)
 
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
 
char *sys_errlist[];
int errno;
</PRE>
<P>The following program lists all the error messages. <PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
 
#define MAXERRNO 90
 
extern int errno;
extern char *sys_errlist[];
 
int main()
{
  int x;
 
  for ( x=0;x &lt; MAXERRNO;x++)    {
      printf("%d %s \n", x, sys_errlist[x]);
  }
  return (0);
}
</PRE>
<P>The return values of both library calls and system calls should be checked 
unless it is not important that the call succeeds. If the call fails, it should 
be handled in an appropriate manner such as a retrying the call, exiting giving 
a appropriate message or executing some other function. Examples of calls that 
should always be checked are <EM>malloc, open, read, write</EM>. If the return 
value of a call is not tested then this intention should be made explicit by 
putting <EM>(void)</EM> in front of the call. </P></BODY></HTML>
