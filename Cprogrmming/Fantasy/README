This is your fantasy directory; see the assignment sheet for detail 
about its initial contents.

Modify and use the shell scripts in .../fantasy/etc to set and 
reset your path.  (Your modification should replace /dcs/eds/fantasy...
the path to your own fantasy directory).

There are both bash and c-shell versions.

Modify the paths in location.h in .../fantasy/src in a similar way,
so that they point to your own fantasy directory.

.../fantasy/world can be initialised from the tar file in ../fantasy/etc
Use `tar xvf initial_world.tar' to do this.

From the directory .../fantasy/src, use `make' to create your initial set 
of binaries.  The makefile in that directory also allows you to make
individual commands and to print off laser copies of all the C sources.

The commands `start', `quit' and `look' are supplied.  You will create the
other commands during the course of this assignment.  You will also 
create an independent dragon that will roam the fantasy world.

The `quit' command will generate an error message because the `score'
command is not yet available.  This will be corrected when you have
written the `score' command.
