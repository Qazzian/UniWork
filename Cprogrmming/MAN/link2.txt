NAME
  link - Creates a hard link to an existing file on the local file system

SYNOPSIS

  #include <unistd.h>

  int link (
	  const char *path1,
	  const char *path2 );

STANDARDS

  Interfaces documented on this reference page conform to industry standards
  as follows:

  link():  XSH5.0

  Refer to the standards(5) reference page for more information about indus-
  try standards and associated tags.

PARAMETERS

  path1	    Points to the pathname of an existing file.

  path2	    Points to the pathname for the directory entry to be created.  If
	    the path2 parameter names a symbolic link, an error is returned.

DESCRIPTION

  The link() function creates an additional hard link (directory entry) for
  an existing file.  The old and the new link share equal access rights to
  the underlying object.  The link() function atomically creates a new link
  for the existing file and increments the link count of the file by one.

  Both the path1 and  path2 parameters must reside on the same file system. A
  hard link to a directory cannot be created.

  Upon successful completion, the link() function marks the st_ctime field of
  the file for update, and marks the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the
  directory containing the new entry for update.

  A process must have write permission in the target directory with respect
  to all access control policies configured on the system.

  See symlink(2) for information about making symbolic links, including Con-
  text Dependent Symbolic Links (CDSLs).

RETURN VALUES

  Upon successful completion, the link() function returns a value of 0
  (zero). If the link() function fails, a value of -1 is returned, no link is
  created, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS

  If the link() function fails, errno may be set to one of the following
  values:

  [EACCES]  The requested link requires writing in a directory with a mode
	    that denies write permission, or a component of either the path1
	    or path2 parameter denies search permission.

  [EACCES]  The requested link requires writing in a directory to which the
	    process does not have write access with respect to one or more of
	    the system's configured access policies.

  [EDQUOT]  The directory in which the entry for the new link is being placed
	    cannot be extended because the user's quota of disk blocks on the
	    file system containing the directory has been exhausted.

  [EEXIST]  The link named by the path2 parameter already exists.

  [EFAULT]  The path1 or path2 parameter is an invalid address.

  [ELOOP]   Too many links were encountered in translating path1 or path2.

  [EMLINK]  The number of links to the file named by path1 would exceed
	    LINK_MAX.

  [ENAMETOOLONG]
	    The length of the path1 or path2 string exceeds PATH_MAX or a
	    pathname component is longer than NAME_MAX.

  [ENOENT]  The file named by the path1 parameter does not exist or the path1
	    or path2 parameter is an empty string.

  [ENOSPC]  The directory in which the entry for the new link is being placed
	    cannot be extended because there is no space left on the file
	    system containing the directory.

  [ENOTDIR] A component of either path prefix is not a directory.

  [EPERM]   The file named by the path1 parameter is a directory.

  [EROFS]   The requested link requires writing in a directory on a read-only
	    file system.

  [EXDEV]   The link named by the path2 parameter and the file named by the
	    path1 parameter are on different file systems.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	For NFS file access, if the link() function fails, errno may
  also be set to one of the following values:

  [ENFILE]  Indicates that the system file table is full or there are too
	    many files currently open in the system.

  [ESTALE]  Indicates a stale NFS file handle.	An opened file was deleted by
	    the server or another client; a client cannot open a file because
	    the server has unmounted or unexported the remote directory; or
	    the directory that contains an opened file was unmounted or unex-
	    ported by the server.
