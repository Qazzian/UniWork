DESCRIPTION
  /usr/bin/cd
     The cd utility will change  the  working  directory  of  the
     current  shell  execution  environment. When invoked with no
     operands, and the HOME environment  variable  is  set  to  a
     non-empty value, the directory named in the HOME environment
     variable will become the new working directory.

  sh
     The Bourne shell built-in cd changes the  current  directory
     to  argument.  The shell parameter HOME is the default argu-
     ment.  The shell parameter CDPATH defines  the  search  path
     for the directory containing argument. Alternative directory
     names are separated by a colon (:).   The  default  path  is
     <null>   (specifying  the  current  directory).  Note:   The
     current directory is specified by a null  path  name,  which
     can  appear  immediately after the equal sign or between the
     colon delimiters anywhere else in the path list. If argument
     begins with `/', `.', or `.. ', the search path is not used.
     Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for  argu-
     ment.  cd must have execute (search) permission in argument.
     Because a new process is created to execute each command, cd
     would be ineffective if it were written as a normal command;
     therefore, it is recognized by and is internal to the shell.
     (See pwd(1), sh(1), and chdir(2)).

     chdir is just another way to call cd.

  csh
     If dir is not specified, the C shell built-in  cd  uses  the
     value  of shell parameter HOME as the new working directory.
     If dir specifies a complete path starting with ` / ', ` . ',
     or ` .. ', dir becomes the new working directory. If neither
     case applies, cd tries  to  find  the  designated  directory
     relative  to  one of the paths specified by the CDPATH shell
     variable. CDPATH
       has the same syntax as, and similar semantics to, the PATH
     shell  variable. cd must have execute (search) permission in
     dir. Because a new process is created to execute  each  com-
     mand, cd would be ineffective if it were written as a normal
     command; therefore, it is recognized by and is  internal  to
     the C-shell. (See pwd(1), sh(1), and chdir(2)).

     chdir changes the shell's  working  directory  to  directory
     dir.  If  no argument is given, change to the home directory
     of the user. If dir is a relative pathname not found in  the
     current  directory, check for it in those directories listed
     in the cdpath variable. If dir is the name of a shell  vari-
     able  whose  value  starts with a /, change to the directory
     named by that value.

     pushd will push a directory onto the directory  stack.  With
     no arguments, exchange the top two elements.

     +n    Rotate the n'th entry to the top of the stack  and  cd
           to it.

     dir   Push the current working directory onto the stack  and
           change to dir.

     popd pops the directory stack and cd to the new  top  direc-
     tory.  The elements of the directory stack are numbered from
     0 starting at the top.

     +n    Discard the n'th entry in the stack.

     dirs will print the directory  stack,  most  recent  to  the
     left;  the  first  directory shown is the current directory.
     With the -l argument, produce an unabbreviated printout; use
     of the ~ notation is suppressed.

  ksh
     The Korn shell built-in cd command can be in either  of  two
     forms.   In  the first form it changes the current directory
     to arg. If arg is - the directory is changed to the previous
     directory.   The shell variable HOME is the default arg. The
     variable PWD is set to the  current  directory.   The  shell
     variable  CDPATH  defines  the search path for the directory

     containing arg. Alternative directory names are separated by
     a  colon  (:).  The  default  path is <null> (specifying the
     current directory).  Note  that  the  current  directory  is
     specified  by a null path name, which can appear immediately
     after the equal sign or between the  colon  delimiters  any-
     where else in the path list. If arg begins with a ` / ', ` .
     ', or ` .. ', then the search path is not  used.  Otherwise,
     each directory in the path is searched for arg.

     The second form of cd substitutes the  string  new  for  the
     string  old  in the current directory name, PWD and tries to
     change to this new directory.

     The cd command may not be executed by rksh.  Because  a  new
     process  is  created  to  execute  each command, cd would be
     ineffective if it were written as a normal  command;  there-
     fore, it is recognized by and is internal to the Korn shell.
     (See pwd(1), sh(1), and chdir(2)).

OPERANDS
     The following operands are supported:

     directory
           An absolute or relative pathname of the directory that
           becomes  the new working directory. The interpretation
           of a relative pathname by cd  depends  on  the  CDPATH
           environment variable.

OUTPUT
     If a non-empty directory name from CDPATH is used, an  abso-
     lute  pathname  of the new working directory will be written
     to the standard output as follows:

          "%s\n", <new directory>


     Otherwise, there will be no output.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment
     variables   that  affect  the  execution  of  cd:  LC_CTYPE,
     LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.

          CDPATH
                A colon-separated list of pathnames that refer to
                directories.  If  the  directory operand does not
                begin with a slash ( / ) character, and the first
                component  is  not dot or dot-dot, cd will search
                for directory relative to each directory named in
                the CDPATH variable, in the order listed. The new
                working directory will be set to the first match-
                ing  directory found. An empty string in place of

                a  directory  pathname  represents  the   current
                directory.  If  CDPATH  is  not  set,  it will be
                treated as if it were an empty string.

          HOME  The name of the  home  directory,  used  when  no
                directory operand is specified.

          PWD   A pathname of the current working directory,  set
                by cd after it has changed to that directory.


EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned by cd:

     0     The directory was successfully changed.

     >0    An error occurred.

ATTRIBUTES
