STANDARDS

  Interfaces documented on this reference page conform to industry standards
  as follows:

  man: POSIX.2, XCU5.0

  Refer to the standards(5) reference page for more information about indus-
  try standards and associated tags.

OPTIONS

  -   [Tru64 UNIX]  Does not pipe output through more for display

  -f title ...
      [Tru64 UNIX]  Describes the specified command, call, function, or file
      name if the whatis keyword database exists.  Performs the same function
      as the whatis command.  You can specify more than one title.

  -k keyword ...
      Locates reference pages whose NAME section contains the specified key-
      word if the whatis database exists.  Performs the same function as the
      apropos command. You can specify more than one keyword.

  -l  [Tru64 UNIX]  Specifies that the reference page resides in a section
      directory subordinate to the /usr/local/man area rather than one subor-
      dinate to the /usr/share/man or /usr/dt/share/man area.

  -M search_path
      [Tru64 UNIX]  Specifies an alternative search path. The search_path
      argument contains one or more pathnames for directories that contain
      section directories (directories named man1, man2, man3, and so forth)
      where reference pages reside.  Use a colon (:) to separate multiple
      pathnames. By default, the man command searches for section directories
      in /usr/share/locale_name/man (if it exists), /usr/share/man,
      /usr/dt/share/man, and /usr/local/man (if it exists) in that order.
      The /usr/share/locale_name/man directory is created when reference page
      translations for a particular locale are installed. The man command
      determines locale_name from the setting of the LC_MESSAGES environment
      variable.

  -P search_path
      [Tru64 UNIX]  Specifies an alternative search path.  (Performs the same
      function as -M search_path and is provided for compatibility with other
      systems.)



OPERANDS

  [section[suffix]]
      [Tru64 UNIX]  Specifies the optional section and suffix identifiers for
      the reference page.

      [Tru64 UNIX]  The section parameter is either a number (0-9), the
      number/letter combination 1m, or one of the letters C, L, F, n, l, p,
      or o. The numbers 1 to 8 and the number/letter combination 1m are most
      appropriate to use with reference pages installed for the Tru64 UNIX
      product. (The number 9 is also appropriate if reference pages are
      available for the device-driver programming kit, which is separately
      installed.) You usually specify section to identify a reference page
      that has the same title as another reference page in a different sec-
      tion.

      [Tru64 UNIX]  The suffix parameter is a string of one or more charac-
      ters, starting with a letter. You usually specify suffix in addition to
      section to identify a reference page that has the same title as another
      reference page in the same section.

  title
      Specifies the name of the reference page.

DESCRIPTION

  The man command provides online access to the system's reference pages. For
  example, if reference pages are available on your system, the following
  command displays the first screenful of reference information for the ls
  command:

       % man ls

  You can press the space bar to see the next screen or press other keys to
  control or search the display. For more information, see the subsection
  entitled Controlling the Pager Used by the man Command.

  The industry standards listed in the STANDARDS section specify the man
  command's exit values and require the command to support the -k option, one
  or more title parameters, and certain environment variables. Much of the
  command's behavior is implementation defined, as indicated by the [Compaq]
  tag that precedes most of the information on this reference page.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	Most reference pages reside in section directories subordi-
  nate to /usr/share/man. Your system manager can optionally create the
  /usr/local/man area as a location for site-specific reference pages.	In
  addition, the area for reference pages provided for the Common Desktop
  Environment (CDE) is /usr/dt/share/man. When all three areas exist on a
  system, the default behavior of the man command is to search for reference
  pages first in /usr/share/man, then in /usr/dt/share/man, and finally in
  /usr/local/man.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	Within a given reference page area, multiple reference pages
  can have the same title. Duplicate titles can be encountered across section
  directories, within section directories, or both. When two reference pages
  have the same title within a section directory, one or both reference pages
  include a suffix in the section identifier.


  [Tru64 UNIX]	If you specify only title in the man command, it displays the
  first title encountered in the section order 1, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, C, L,
  F, n, l, p, o, 1m, 9.	 If there is more than one title in the same section,
  the reference page without a section suffix has precedence over reference
  pages that have section suffixes. When duplicate titles are encountered
  with the same section and different suffixes, suffixes are ordered
  alphabetically.  In this case, the reference page whose suffix occurs ear-
  liest in alphabetical order has precedence. The section and suffix operands
  are available to specify which reference page you want to see when more
  than one instance of titles is available.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	If you specify section, the man command looks for the speci-
  fied titles only in the directories for the specified sections. For all
  number sections and all but one of the letter section identifiers, the com-
  mand must find the title in a directory that corresponds to the specified
  section. For example, when you enter the command man 3 printf, the command
  looks for the printf title only in a man3 directory. The exception to this
  rule is that if you specify the section as the number 1 or letter C, the
  man command searches sections C, n, l, p, o, and 1 in that order.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	A section identifier corresponds to a particular category of
  information and, with the exception of C, to only one corresponding direc-
  tory.	 In the following list, an asterisk (*) follows the section descrip-
  tion when it applies to reference pages installed for the Tru64 UNIX pro-
  duct:

  0   Not used.

  1   Reference pages for commands that all users can enter (*).

  1m  Reference pages for commands related to system maintenance and opera-
      tion (*, for Common Desktop Environment only).

  2   Reference pages for system calls, or program interfaces to the operat-
      ing system kernel (*).

  3   Reference pages for program interfaces found in various libraries (*).

  4   Reference pages for include files, program output files, and some sys-
      tem files (*).

  5   Reference pages on miscellaneous topics, such as text-processing macro
      packages (*).

  6   Reference pages for games.

  7   Reference pages for device special files, related driver functions, and
      networking support (*).

  8   Reference pages for commands related to system maintenance and opera-
      tion (*).

  9   Reference pages used for writing device drivers.

  C   Reference pages for commands.

  F   Reference pages for files.

  L   Reference pages for libraries.

  l   Reference pages with local (site-specific) information.

  n   New reference pages.

  o   Old reference pages.

  p   Public reference pages.






				       Note

	 Almost all implementations of a UNIX operating system use reference
	 page sections 4, 5, and 7 to describe different types of files.
	 However, the type of file described in each section varies from one
	 implementation to another. For example, on ULTRIX and some other
	 UNIX implementations, Section 4 describes device special files
	 rather than include files, Section 5 describes include files rather
	 than macro packages, and Section 7 describes macro packages rather
	 than device special files.



  [Tru64 UNIX]	You need to specify section only if either of the following
  conditions is true:

    o  The reference page is in section 0.

    o  There are two reference pages with the same name (title) in different
       sections, and the reference page you want to see is not the one that
       the man command displays by default.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	If you specify suffix along with section, the man command
  looks only for the reference page that has both the specified section and
  the specified suffix.	 You need to specify suffix in addition to section
  only when both of the following conditions are true:

    o  There is more than one reference page with the same title in the same
       section

    o  The reference page you want to see is not the one that the man command
       displays by default.

       For example, if both abort(3) and abort(3f) exist in a man3 directory,
       the command man 3 abort displays abort(3). In this case, you would
       need to enter the command man 3f abort to display abort(3f).

  [Tru64 UNIX]	In the man command's default search path are two locations
  intended for site-specific reference pages:

    o  A section directory named manl (l for local) in the /usr/share/man
       area

    o  Section directories subordinate to the /usr/local/man area

  [Tru64 UNIX]	One, both, or neither of these locations may exist on your
  system.  They are created by the system administrator.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	If you include the -l option in the man command, you specify
  reference pages in the /usr/local/man area. If you include the l section
  identifier, you specify reference pages in a manl section directory. For
  example, the command man -l 5 print specifies print(5), whose file resides
  in /usr/local/man/man5. The command man l print specifies print(1), whose
  file resides in /usr/share/man/manl.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	The man command's section and title arguments can be paired
  so that a series of titles can be searched for in a section, or multiple
  sections can be searched for one or more titles.


  Changing the man Command's Search Path


  [Tru64 UNIX]	By default, the man command checks for reference pages first
  in the /usr/share/man area, then in the /usr/dt/share/man area, and finally
  in the /usr/local/man area. You can change this behavior by supplying a
  search path with the -M or -P option or by defining the MANPATH variable.
  You can define the MANPATH variable on the command line or in a file, such
  as your .profile file or .login file (if you want the path change to always
  apply to your process). The search path is a colon-separated list of direc-
  tories in which man expects to find the section subdirectories. The string
  /usr/share/%L/man:/usr/dt/share/man:/usr/local/man represents the default
  search path.	The default path includes %L, which is one of the following
  locale directives that can be included in pathnames:

  %L  The current locale name (for example, zh_CN.dechanzi@radical) that is
      the value of the LC_MESSAGES environment variable

  %P  The same as %L except that the @ suffix is removed if the locale name
      has such a suffix (for example, zh_CN.dechanzi)

      A few locales have one or more variants to support different collating
      orders and these variants include an @ suffix. Users may assign a
      locale variant name to the LANG or LC_ALL variable rather than specifi-
      cally to the LC_COLLATE variable. In this case, the LC_MESSAGES vari-
      able would inherit its value from the LANG or LC_ALL variable.  The %P
      ensures that the man command does not expect to find a reference page
      directory whose name includes the @ suffix.

  %l  The language element of the locale name currently assigned to the
      LC_MESSAGES variable (for example, zh)

  %t  The territory element of the locale name currently assigned to the
      LC_MESSAGES variable (for example, CN)

  %c  The codeset element of the locale name currently assigned to the
      LC_MESSAGES variable (for example, dechanzi)

  %%  A single percent sign (%) character

  [Tru64 UNIX]	The following search path example changes the order in which
  reference page areas are searched. It also adds support for installations
  of reference page translations within the CDE and site-specific areas:

       % setenv MANPATH /usr/local/%L/man:/usr/dt/share/%L/man:/usr/share/%L/man

  [Tru64 UNIX]	The following search path example adds the directory
  /usr/share/doclib/annex/man:

       % setenv MANPATH \
       /usr/share/%L/man:/usr/dt/share/%L/man:/usr/share/doclib/annex/man

  [Tru64 UNIX]	The /usr/share/doclib/annex/man area is the location of sup-
  plementary reference pages for certain components, such as perl, which have
  been obtained from the public domain or the Free Software Foundation.
  Files installed under /usr/share/doclib/annex/man are not checked for
  technical accuracy and coding by Compaq, nor are they maintained by Compaq.
  These files are included for the convenience of customers without Internet
  access. (In all cases, the same files can be downloaded over the Internet
  from the contributing third-party site without charge.)

  [Tru64 UNIX]	The /usr/share/doclib/annex/man directory is not part of the
  default search path for the man and catman commands because of the higher
  probability of processing problems, particularly for catman when producing
  the whatis database. However, it is easy to adjust MANPATH on a user-
  specific basis so that the installed reference pages are automatically
  found by the man command.




				     Note

       [Tru64 UNIX]  Some users indirectly use the webman script, also con-
       trolled by the MANPATH setting, to dynamically convert reference page
       source files to HTML format for viewing in a web browser. These users
       should be aware that the webman script may not convert to HTML all of
       the man coding constructs that can be found in third-party reference
       pages.

  Enabling Codeset Conversion of Translated Reference Pages


  [Tru64 UNIX]	The man command can automatically invoke the iconv utility to
  perform codeset conversion of reference page files. This capability allows
  you to install one set of reference pages to support locales that have the
  same language and territory but different codesets, thereby reducing file
  redundancy on the system. To enable codeset conversion, the following con-
  ditions must be met:

    o  The LC_MESSAGES locale category of the process running the man command
       must be set to the locale name to which the reference pages will be
       converted.

    o  The underlying iconv utility must have a converter available for the
       source and destination codesets. Refer to the iconv(1) reference page
       for more information about codeset converters.

    o  An appropriate locale mapping file must exist in the /usr/share direc-
       tory.

       A locale mapping file is a hidden file whose name has the format
       .man_conv-locale_name, where locale_name is a complete locale name
       that includes the name of the destination codeset.  The content of the
       locale mapping file is the locale with the source codeset for which
       translated manpages are available.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	For example, after installing Tru64 UNIX subsets of software
  and translated reference pages for Japanese, the eucJP_SJIS codeset con-
  verter is installed in the /usr/lib/nls/loc/iconv directory, manpages for
  the ja_JP.eucJP locale are installed in the /usr/share/ja_JP.eucJP/man
  directory, and the .man_conv-ja_JP.SJIS file, which contains the
  ja_JP.eucJP locale name, is moved to the /usr/share directory.  When users
  set locale to ja_JP.SJIS and run the man command, it accesses the reference
  pages in the /usr/share/ja_JP.eucJP/man directory and converts them to the
  SJIS codeset for display.

  Controlling the Pager Used by the man Command


  [Tru64 UNIX]	By default, you can use the following keys to control and
  navigate the reference page display:

  Return or Enter
      Advances the display by one line.

  Space Bar
      Advances the display by one screen.

  u   Backs up the display by one half screen.

  /string
      Searches for the first instance of the specified string.

  n   Searches for the next instance of the string specified by a preceding
      /string directive.

  q   Stops the display.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	Refer to the more(1) reference page for a complete discussion
  of pager subcommands.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	By default, if the standard output is a teletype and the -
  (single minus sign) option is not provided, man uses the more -svf command
  to display formatted output. The -vf options are present in case the lp
  nroff device driver generates special device control codes.

  The following conditions also affect how the man command displays output:

    o  If the MORE environment variable is defined, the man command uses the
       defined command line in place of more -svf. If the -v and -f options
       are missing, reference pages may not display properly.

    o  If another pager is defined for the PAGER environment variable, the
       man command uses that pager in place of the more command.

  Formatted Reference Pages


  [Tru64 UNIX]	A reference page area may or may not contain cat? directories
  with formatted reference pages. Your system administrator can create these
  directories and preformat reference page source files by using the catman
  command (see catman(8)).  The man command checks to see if a preformatted
  version of a reference page exists and, if it does and has a more recent
  date than the corresponding source file, the command simply displays the
  preformatted file using the more command or the defined pager.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	If the specified reference page exists only as a source file,
  the man command processes the file through a pipeline of commands.  This
  pipeline includes:

    o  [Tru64 UNIX]  If the file is compressed, the gunzip command to
       uncompress the file

    o  [Tru64 UNIX]  The tbl and neqn commands to preprocess source markup
       for tables and equations

    o  [Tru64 UNIX]  The nroff command to create formatted output

    o  The more command or an alternative pager command (if defined) to
       display the file

       [Tru64 UNIX]  This last step does not occur if you specify the -
       option on the man command line or if standard output is not a teletype
       device (for example, if you pipe man command output to another command
       or redirect it to a file).

  [Tru64 UNIX]	When processing the reference page through nroff, the man
  command specifies the -m option with the name of the macro package
  described in man(5). Most Tru64 UNIX reference pages require not only this
  macro package but also those described in rsml(5). The additional macro
  packages are applied using .so entries in the reference page source files
  and not through the nroff command line invoked by the man command.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	The nroff command invoked by man also includes the -Tdevice
  option. The value for device differs, depending on whether cat? directories
  are present when the source file is formatted. When the appropriate cat?
  directory is present and does not contain a formatted version of the refer-
  ence page, the man command formats source by creating output for the nroff
  lp device.  It also saves the formatted output in the cat? directory. If
  the cat? directory is absent, the man command formats a reference page by
  creating output for the nroff lpr device and does not save the formatted
  output.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	If a preformatted version of the reference page exists, but
  the source version is more recent than the preformatted one, the man com-
  mand does not use the preformatted file. The command formats the source
  file and replaces the preformatted file with a new version.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	When a specified reference page is not formatted or is being
  formatted again, the man command displays an appropriate status message,
  unless the standard output is not a teletype device. For example, the
  status message is not displayed when output from the man command is
  redirected to a file or piped to another command.

  Reference Pages in Compressed Format


  [Tru64 UNIX]	The man command supports reference page files in either
  compressed or uncompressed format.  Compressed files can save a significant
  amount of disk space in the file system where reference page subsets are
  installed.  The reference page files for the operating system product are
  installed as .gz files, which are compressed files created by the gzip com-
  mand.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	To display a compressed reference page, the man command tem-
  porarily uncompresses the file by invoking the gunzip utility with the -c
  option before invoking other commands to format (if necessary) and display
  the reference page.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	There are a number of requirements and restrictions that
  apply to reference pages in compressed format. For more information, refer
  to both the Reference Page Pointers section in this DESCRIPTION and the
  RESTRICTIONS section.

  Reference Page Pointers


  [Tru64 UNIX]	Reference page directories can contain cross-reference
  (pointer) reference pages.  Pointers, which invoke another reference page,
  support those reference page files that contain multiple names in the NAME
  section. The pointers allow users to invoke a reference page by specifying
  any of the names in the NAME section, not only the name of the reference
  page itself.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	The man command supports different kinds of pointers, depend-
  ing on whether reference page files are compressed or uncompressed, source
  files, or preformatted files.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	When reference page files are compressed (either source files
  in man? directories or preformatted files in cat? directories), their asso-
  ciated pointers must be implemented as hard links. Furthermore, each
  pointer file name must end with the same compression extension as the file
  that the pointer invokes. For example, if a reference page was compressed
  by the gzip command, both the reference page file name and those of its
  pointers, must end in .gz.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	When uncompressed reference pages reside in cat? directories,
  pointers are symbolic links to the files that the command displays.  When
  uncompressed reference pages reside in man? directories, pointers are one-
  line files.  The one line is an nroff include directive that has one of the
  following formats:

  .so man?/title2.section

  .soman?/title2.section

  [Tru64 UNIX]	In this case, the man command will reformat the title2 refer-
  ence page, if necessary, and save the output in the file title2.section in
  the appropriate cat? directory, assuming the cat? directory exists.

RESTRICTIONS

  This section contains restrictions that apply to the man command and the
  files that it processes.

  Pathnames in Uncompressed Pointer Files Must Start With man?


  [Tru64 UNIX]	The man command changes directory to /usr/share/man,
  /usr/dt/share/man, /usr/local/man, or to those directories specified with
  the MANPATH variable, the -M option, or -P option.  Some reference pages
  assume this change of directory.  Therefore, an attempt to format
  uncompressed reference pages can fail if any .so directives specifying par-
  tial pathnames do not start with man?/. For example, a cross-reference file
  that includes the cat(1) reference page must specify man1 in the pathname:

       .so man1/cat.1

  Pointers Must Reside in Same Area as Related Files


  [Tru64 UNIX]	The man command does not support cross-references to files
  outside the current reference page area.  For example, a pointer that
  resides in the /usr/local/man area cannot include or invoke a file that
  resides in the /usr/share/man area.

  Compressed Pointers Cannot Be Copied Across File Systems


  [Tru64 UNIX]	A pointer associated with a compressed reference page is a
  hard link, which is not a file but an alternative entry in a file system
  table for a particular file. Hard links cannot be transferred from one file
  system to another by using commands, such as cp, rcp, or mv. These commands
  cannot determine which entries in a file system table point to the same
  file, and so copy the file that is pointed to into the destination area
  each time a hard link is encountered.	 Reference pages can have many asso-
  ciated pointers. Therefore, an operation that moves directories of
  compressed reference pages from one file system to another consumes far
  more disk space in the destination area than was required in the source
  area.

  The cat? Directories May Not Exist


  [Tru64 UNIX]	The .../man/cat? directories are not required. It is the
  option of the system administrator to create these directories and prefor-
  mat reference page source files using the catman command. If you are creat-
  ing reference pages to be installed on multiple systems, be sure to supply
  the files in source file format so they can reside in the man? directories.

  Most Commands Cannot Work Directly on Compressed Files


  [Tru64 UNIX]	Most reference page files are installed in compressed format,
  which means that they cannot be processed directly by most commands. How-
  ever, you can use the gunzip -c (or gzip -u -c) command to uncompress the
  files and direct the result to standard output for additional processing.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	The following examples search the man8 directory to find
  reference pages that contain the string "install".

  For POSIX (including Korn) and Bourne shells:


       $ cd /usr/share/man/man8
       $ for i in *.gz; do
       > gunzip -c $i | grep 'install' >&- && echo "*** $i"
       > gunzip -c $i | grep 'install'
       > done

  For C shell:

       % cd /usr/share/man/man8
       % foreach i (*.gz)
       > gunzip -c $i | grep 'install' >/dev/null && echo "*** $i"
       > gunzip -c $i | grep 'install'
       > end

  The whatis Database Is Required for Some Commands


  [Tru64 UNIX]	The man -f (whatis) and man -k (apropos) commands fail unless
  a whatis keyword database exists in one or more of the reference page areas
  in the man command search path. A default whatis database is included in
  the Tru64 UNIX product and can be optionally installed by your system
  administrator.  This database is copied to the /usr/share/man directory and
  includes entries for all the Tru64 UNIX reference page subsets that are
  installed on the system.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	The whatis database is not updated automatically when refer-
  ence pages for layered products and other kinds of optional software are
  installed.  Therefore, your system administrator should rebuild the whatis
  database after installation of reference pages for optional products by
  invoking catman with the -w option.

  Changing Setting for lp Device Affects Preformatted Reference Pages


  [Tru64 UNIX]	When cat? directories are present, source reference pages are
  formatted for the nroff lp device rather than the nroff lpr device. The
  nroff lp device driver supplied with Tru64 UNIX is set to generate output
  for Compaq Equipment Corporation devices as specified in term(4).  If your
  system administrator changes the supplied setting for the nroff lp device,
  all preformatted reference page files created by man or catman should be
  deleted and reformatted for the new setting.

  Preformatted Reference Pages May Not Be Suitable for Printing


  [Tru64 UNIX]	Preformatted reference pages may not be in a format suitable
  for printing on your hardcopy printers because of embedded control charac-
  ters that the printers do not recognize. To format a reference page for a
  specific printer, move to the reference page directory and issue commands
  such as the following:

       % cd /usr/share/man
       % gunzip -c man1/ls.1.gz |tbl |neqn |nroff -Tdevice -man | \
       lpr -Pmyprinter

  [Tru64 UNIX]	Replace the device argument with
  /usr/share/lib/term/tabdevice, where device is the name of a device listed
  in term(4). Specify lpr for device when producing output suitable for a
  lineprinter. For example:

       % cd /usr/share/man
       % gunzip -c man1/ls.1.gz |tbl |neqn |nroff -Tlpr -man | \
       lpr -Pmyprinter

  [Tru64 UNIX]	When cat? directories are absent, the man command invokes
  nroff by specifying the lpr device. In this case, you can usually pipe man
  command output directly to a printer or redirect the output to a file that
  you can print. For example:

       % man 1 ls | lpr -Pmyprinter
       % man 1 ls > ~harry/ls.1.txt

  [Tru64 UNIX]	If the reference page has tables and the hardcopy device is
  not capable of reverse line movements, the reference page may not print
  properly.  There is no workaround for this problem.

  Non-Compaq Terminals May Not Display Preformatted Files Correctly


  [Tru64 UNIX]	Preformatted reference pages may not be in a format suitable
  for display on non-Compaq terminals.	To format a reference page for a
  specific terminal, move to the reference page directory and issue commands
  such as the following:

       % cd /usr/share/man
       % gunzip -c man1/ls.1.gz |tbl |neqn |nroff -Tdevice -man -h | more -svf

  [Tru64 UNIX]	Replace the device argument with
  /usr/share/lib/term/tabdevice, where device is the name of a device listed
  in term(4) and is one appropriate for your terminal.

  Nondefault Tab Settings Can Corrupt man Command Displays


  [Tru64 UNIX]	You can view reference pages only on devices for which
  default tab boundaries are in effect.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	To format reference page source files, the man and catman
  commands invoke nroff with the -h option. This option causes nroff to sub-
  stitute a a tab character for each string of one or more spaces that ends
  on a default tab boundary. This operation reduces the number of characters
  sent to devices for printing or display and also reduces the size of files
  saved in the cat? directories.

  [Tru64 UNIX]	Default tab boundaries are set after every eight character
  positions. If nondefault tab boundaries have been set on the device or sys-
  tem on which reference pages are displayed, the tab characters embedded by
  nroff corrupt reference page displays with inappropriate sequences of
  spaces. If you encounter this problem after using the man command, enter
  the command tabs (to restore default tab boundaries on your display device)
  and then enter the man command again.

EXIT STATUS

  The man command returns the following exit values:

  0 (zero)
      Success.

  >0 (greater than zero)
      Failure.






EXAMPLES

   1.  Display the printf(1) reference page:
	    % man printf

   2.  [Tru64 UNIX]  Display the printf(3) reference page:
	    % man 3 printf

   3.  [Tru64 UNIX]  Display the mgr_helper(8) reference page that you
       created in a man8 section directory under $HOME/mgr:
	    % man -M $HOME/mgr mgr_helper

   4.  [Tru64 UNIX]  Display reference pages with the title locale in sec-
       tions 1 and 4:
	    % man 1 locale 4 locale

   5.  Query the whatis database for reference pages whose NAME sections
       include the string "core":
	    % man -k core



ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  The following environment variables affect the behavior of the man command:

  LANG
      Provides a default value for other locale variables when these are
      unset or null.

  LC_ALL
      If set to a non-empty string, overrides the values of all other locale
      variables, including LANG.

  LC_CTYPE
      Determines the locale for the interpretation of byte sequences as char-
      acters in text data.

  LC_MESSAGES
      Determines the locale used for text written to standard error or stan-
      dard output.

  NLSPATH
      Determines the root directory for message catalogs containing informa-
      tional, diagnostic, and other messages returned by the command. The
      NLSPATH value, in combination with the setting of LC_MESSAGES, speci-
      fies the directory in which a locale-specific message catalog is found.

  PAGER
      Determines the command (pager) that man invokes to filter output when
      writing output to a terminal.

      A default pager must exist and is implementation defined. On Tru64 UNIX
      systems, the default pager used by man is the more command.
