----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Installation:
----------------

For people familiar with their command-line interface
-----------------------------------------------------

a) Set WEKAHOME to be the directory which contains this README.
b) Add $WEKAHOME/weka.jar to your CLASSPATH environment variable.
c) Bookmark $WEKAHOME/doc/packages.html in your web browser.


To start a GUI for using Weka
-----------------------------

Currently this GUI just acts like a simple command shell -- something
better will come later :-))

If you are using Java 2 (JDK 1.2 or equivalent), you should be able
to just double-click on the weka.jar icon, or from a command-line (assuming
you are in the directory containing weka.jar) type

java -jar weka.jar
or if you are using Windows use
javaw -jar weka.jar

If you are using some other Java virtual machine you need to start
SimpleCLI from within weka.jar. For JDK 1.1 users something
like the following:

java -classpath weka.jar:$CLASSPATH SimpleCLI
or if you are using Windows use
javaw -classpath weka.jar;$CLASSPATH SimpleCLI


----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Getting started:
-------------------

In the following, the names of files assume use of a unix command-line
with environment variables. For other command-lines (including SimpleCLI)
you should substitute the name of the directory where weka.jar lives 
where you see $WEKAHOME. If your platform uses something other than / as
the path separator, also make the appropriate substitutions.

===========
Classifiers
===========

Try:

java weka.classifiers.j48.J48 -t $WEKAHOME/data/iris.arff

This prints out a decision tree classifier for the iris dataset 
and ten-fold cross-validation estimates of its performance. If you
don't pass any options to the classifier, WEKA will list all the 
available options. Try:

java weka.classifiers.j48.J48

The options are divided into "general" options that apply to most
classification schemes in WEKA, and scheme-specific options that 
only apply to the current scheme---in this case J48. WEKA has a
common interface to all classification methods. Any class that 
implements a classifier can be used in the same way as J48 is used
above. WEKA knows that a class implements a classifier if it 
extends the Classifier or DistributionClassifier classes in
weka.classifiers. Almost all classes in weka.classifiers fall into
this category. Try, for example:

java weka.classifiers.NaiveBayes -t $WEKAHOME/data/labor.arff

Here is a list of the most important classifiers currently 
implemented in weka.classifiers:

a) Classifiers for categorical prediction:

weka.classifiers.IBk: k-nearest neighbour learner
weka.classifiers.j48.J48: C4.5 decision trees 
weka.classifiers.j48.PART: rule learner 
weka.classifiers.NaiveBayes: naive Bayes with/without kernels
weka.classifiers.OneR: Holte's OneR
weka.classifiers.KernelDensity: kernel density classifier
weka.classifiers.SMO: support vector machines
weka.classifiers.Logistic: logistic regression
weka.classifiers.AdaBoostM1: AdaBoost
weka.classifiers.LogitBoost: logit boost
weka.classifiers.DecisionStump: decision stumps (for boosting)

b) Classifiers for numeric prediction:

weka.classifiers.LinearRegression: linear regression
weka.classifiers.m5.M5Prime: model trees
weka.classifiers.IBk: k-nearest neighbour learner
weka.classifiers.LWR: locally weighted regression
weka.classifiers.RegressionByDiscretization: uses categorical classifiers

=================
Association rules
=================

Next to classification schemes, there is some other useful stuff in 
WEKA. Association rules, for example, can be extracted using the 
apriori algorithm. Try

java weka.associations.Apriori -t $WEKAHOME/data/weather.nominal.arff

=======
Filters
=======

There are also a number of tools that allow you to manipulate a
dataset. These tools are called filters in WEKA and can be found
in weka.filters.

weka.filters.DiscretizeFilter: discretizes numeric data
weka.filters.AttributeFilter: deletes/selects attributes
etc.

Try:

java weka.filters.DiscretizeFilter -i $WEKAHOME/data/iris.arff -c last

===========
Data format
===========

Datasets in WEKA have to be formatted according to the arff 
format. Examples of arff files can be found in $WEKAHOME/data. 
What follows is a short description of the file format. 

A dataset has to start with a declaration of its name:

@relation name

followed by a list of all the attributes in the dataset (including 
the class attribute). These declarations have the form

@attribute attribute_name specification


If an attribute is nominal, specification contains a list of the 
possible attribute values in curly brackets:

@attribute nominal_attribute {first_value, second_value, third_value}


If an attribute is numeric, specification is replaced by the keyword 
numeric: (Integer values are treated as real numbers in WEKA.)

@attribute numeric_attribute numeric


In addition to these two types of attributes, there also exists a
string attribute type. This attribute provides the possibility to
store a comment or ID field for each of the instances in a dataset:

@attribute string_attribute string

After the attribute declarations, the actual data is introduced by a 

@data

tag, which is followed by a list of all the instances. The instances 
are listed in comma-separated format, with a question mark 
representing a missing value. Comments are lines starting with %

4. Tutorial:
------------

A tutorial on how to use WEKA is in $WEKAHOME/Tutorial.pdf. However,
not everything in WEKA is covered in the Tutorial. For a complete list
you have to look at the online documentation
$WEKAHOME/doc/packages.html.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Source code:
---------------

The source code for WEKA is in $WEKAHOME/weka-src.jar. To expand it, 
use the jar utility that's in every Java distribution.

7. Call for code and bug reports:
---------------------------------

If you have implemented a learning scheme, filter, application,
visualization tool, etc., using the WEKA classes, and you think it 
should be included in WEKA, send us the code, and we can put it
in the next WEKA distribution.

If you find any bugs, send a fix to wekasupport@cs.waikato.ac.nz.
If that's too hard, just send us a bug report.
