<LI>
It  is widely recognised that the development and adoption of  standards 
is a critical activity in the world of computer communications.
<P>
<ol type="a">
<li>
What  types of organisations are involved in the creation  of  standards 
and from where do they draw their members? [9 Marks]
<P>
<li>
Explain why the standards process can be time consuming. [6 marks]
<P>
<li>
Explain  what  is meant by <I><B>de-facto</B></I> standards and  their  importance  to 
users. [6 marks]
<P>
<LI>
Explain  the importance of the ISO Open Systems Connection  (OSI)  Model 
and describe the roles of the layers which it includes.	[12 marks]
</ol>
<P>
<LI>
This  question  is  concerned with basic  terminology  and  concepts  of 
computer communications.
<P>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Briefly explain the meaning of the following pairs of technical terms
<p>
<dl>
<dd>(i)	&nbsp; <I><B>digital</B></I> and <I><B>analogue</B></I> [3 marks]
<dd>(ii) &nbsp;<B><I>serial</I></B> and <B><I>parallel</I></B> [3 marks]
<dd>(iii) <I><B>Local Area Network</B></I> and <B><I>Wide Area Network</I></B> [6 marks]
</dl>
<P>
<li>
Explain  the  role of a <B><I>modem</I></B> and briefly describe either <B> <I>amplitude</I></B>  or 
<B><I>frequency</I></B> modulation. [8 marks]
<p>
<li>
Briefly  describe  the hybrid modulation technique  known  as <I> <B>amplitude 
modulated phase shift keying</B></I>. [5 marks]
<p>
<li>
Outline  some  of the reasons why there are real limits on  the  maximum 
rate  at  which  a  modem can transmit  data  via  the  public  switched 
telephone  network  (PSTN).  What formulas have   Shannon,  Hartley  and 
Nyquist developed to express these limits? [8 marks]
</ol>
<P>
<LI>
In recent years the networking of computers has become a critical  issue 
in  the  operation of many organizations. Ethernet is one  of  the  most 
widely  available  technologies used to provide communication  within  a 
small geographic region such as a department, building, or campus.
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
With  reference  to  the local area network  (LAN)  known  as  Ethernet, 
explain  the  role of each of the  following  networking  components:[12 
marks]
<P>
<dl>
<dd>(i)	&nbsp; <B><I>terminator</I></B>
<dd>(ii) &nbsp;<B><I>repeater</I></B>
<dd>(iii) <B><I>bridge</I></B>
<dd>(iv) &nbsp;<B><I>transceiver (MAU)</I></B>
</dl>
<P>
<li>
Describe  the  access  protocol known as CSMA/CD  utilized  for  10BASE2 
Ethernet. Include in your answer the characteristics of a network  using 
this protocol and the reasons why a minimum packet size is required  for 
its correct operation. [12 marks]
<P>
<li>
Outline the<I><B> truncated binary exponential backoff algorithm</B></I> used when two 
stations attempt to transmit almost simultaneously. Propose reasons  why 
this  ensures good network behaviour under conditions of heavy load.  [9 
marks]
</ol>
<P>
<LI>
The  Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is now widely  available 
from  telecommunications operators in many countries of the world.  Many 
other  services  are also available which are provided mainly  for  data 
use.
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Briefly describe <B><I>ISDN</I></B> and what facilities <B><I>basic rate access</I></B> provides  to 
a user. [7 marks]
<p>
<li>
Explain what is meant by each of the following ISDN services,  including 
examples where appropriate: [12 marks]
<P>
<dl>
<dd>(i) &nbsp; <B><I>Bearer service</I></B>
<dd>(ii) &nbsp;<B><I>Teleservice service</I></B>
<dd>(iii) <B><I>Supplementary service</I></B>
</dl>
<p>
<LI>
Describe  what  factors a network manager might consider  when  deciding 
whether  ISDN  or  leased  lines  might  provide  the  most  appropriate 
communications links for use within a new project. [10 marks]
<P>
<li>
When  choosing  between  leased  lines, when  might  analogue  lines  be 
preferred over digital lines and vice-versa? [4 marks]
</ol>
<P>
<LI>
This question is concerned with the topic known as Information Theory.
<P>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Explain  informally why the <B><I>data content</I></B>  and <I><B>information content</B></I>  of  a 
message  are  not  necessarily the same. Explain what is  meant  by  the 
<B><I>entropy</I></B>  of a message source. [3 marks]
<p>
<li>
Explain what is meant by a <B><I>variable length code</I></B>. Outline in your answer 
why  a  variable  length  code might provide a  more  efficient  set  of 
codewords for an alphabet of symbols than a <B><I>fixed length code</I></B>. [5 marks]
<p>
<li>
An alphabet consists of 7 symbols A to G inclusive.  The letter A occurs 
with  probability  6/16, both B and C occur with probability  3/16,  the 
remainder all have probability 1/16.
<p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
What  is the minimum codeword size possible using a <B><I>fixed length  binary 
coding</I></B>? [2 marks]
<p>
<li>
Produce a <B><I>Huffman coding</I></B> for these symbols. [10 marks]
<P>
<li> 
Calculate the <B><I>average code length</I></B>  for a symbol  encoded  using 
the Huffman code developed in part (ii). [4 marks]
</ol>
<P>
<li>
Many   compression  algorithms  used  for  video  encoding  succeed   in 
compressing  a  data source far below the theoretical  limit  calculated 
from its entropy.
<P>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Why is this possible? [4 marks]
<p>
<li>
Which  applications  would  this  approach be  suitable  for  and  which 
applications would we not expect to compress below the theoretical limit 
given by the entropy?  Give reasons for your answers. [5 marks]
