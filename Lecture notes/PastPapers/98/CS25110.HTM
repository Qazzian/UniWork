A  small  company with two branch offices has been in existence  for  10 
years  and  is a provider of educational services.  Until  now,  it  has 
focused mainly on the design and production of paper based materials and 
it  also  provides  telephone  support.   The  company  has  decided  to 
modernise  its  offerings  and intends to provide  web  based  materials 
including audio and video footage and intends to offer videophone  based 
support  to  its  clients.  The company intends to dispose  of  all  its 
telephones,  fax machines and typewriters and equip each of its  workers 
with  one multi-functional PC-based workstation. This  equipment  should 
also  be used to enable staff at the two offices to co-operate on  joint 
projects.   The telecommunications equipment in the towns where the  two 
offices  are  located have recently been modernised and  so  all  common 
services are now available.
<P>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Produce  a  brief description of an  appropriate  workstation,  focusing 
mainly  on the peripheral devices and supporting interfaces as  well  as 
the various communications interfaces that are likely to be needed.  [12 
Marks]
<P>
<li>
Describe the various application and system software components that are 
going  to  be  required in the workstation to support  its  use  by  the 
workers. [12 marks]
<p>
<li>
What  role  should  standards  within  the  workstation  play  in   this 
particular case study?  Your answer should include reference to the role 
of  proprietary specifications in providing a basis for  connecting  the 
company's  machines  to  those of its clients as well  as  for  ensuring 
future upgrades. [9 marks]

In recent years the networking of computers has become a critical  issue 
in  the  operation of many organizations. Ethernet is one  of  the  most 
widely  available  technologies used to provide communication  within  a 
small geographic region such as a department, building, or campus.
<P>
<ol type="a">
<li>
With  reference  to  the local area network  (LAN)  known  as  Ethernet, 
explain  the  role of each of the following networking  components:  [12

<P>
<dl>
<dd>(i) &nbsp; <B><I>terminator</I></B>
<dd>(ii) &nbsp;<B><I>repeater</I></B>
<dd>(iii) <B><I>bridge</I></B>
<dd>(iv)&nbsp;<B><I>transceiver (MAU)</I></B>
</dl>
<P>
<li>
Describe  the  access  protocol known as CSMA/CD  utilized  for  10BASE2 
Ethernet. Include in your answer the characteristics of a network  using 
this protocol and the reasons why a minimum packet size is required  for 
its correct operation. [12 marks]
<p>
<li>
Outline the <B><I>truncated binary exponential backoff algorithm</I></B> used when two 
stations attempt to transmit almost simultaneously. Propose reasons  why 
this  ensures good network behaviour under conditions of heavy load.  [9 
marks]
</ol>
<P>
<LI>
Optical  fibre media have led to massive improvements in the  speed  and 
reliability  of  Wide  Area Networks, leading in  turn  to  several  new 
technologies such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Frame Relay.
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Outline  the  major differences between  traditional  <I><B>packet  switching, 
frame relay</B></I> and <B><I>ATM</I></B>  technologies. [8 marks]
<p>
<li>
The  concept  of a <B>Virtual Circuit</B> is important for several  high  speed 
technologies.  Explain what is meant by the term <B><I>Virtual Circuit</I></B> and how 
this differs from a pure <B>datagram</B> approach. [6 marks]
<p>
<li>
Explain  why   <B>Frame  Relay</B> is more efficient  than  traditional  <B>Packet 
switching</B> when used over transmission media which have a low probability 
of errors. [10 marks]
<p>
<li>
Briefly  discuss  how  an  ATM network can  support  a  wider  range  of 
applications  than networks constructed using packet switching or  Frame 
relay. [9 marks]
</ol>
<P>
<LI>
The  Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is now widely  available 
from telecommunications operators in many countries of the world.
<P>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Briefly describe <B>ISDN</B> and what facilities <B>basic rate access</B> provides  to 
a user. [7 marks]
<p>
<li>
Explain what is meant by each of the following ISDN services,  including 
examples where appropriate: [12 marks]
<P>
<dl>
<dd>(i) &nbsp; <B><I>Bearer service</I></B>
<dd>(ii) &nbsp;<B><I>Teleservice service</I></B>
<dd>(iii) <B><I>Supplementary service</I></B>
</dl>
<p>
<li>
Explain the term <I><B>flow control</B></I> and the mechanisms which might be used  to 
provide it on a <B><I>full duplex channel</I></B>. [7 marks]
<p>
<li>
Explain the term <I><B>error control</B></I> and the mechanisms which might be used to 
provide it on a <I><B>full duplex channel</B></I>. [7 marks]

<P>
<LI>
This question is concerned with the topic known as Information Theory.
<P>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Explain  informally why the <B><I>data content</I></B>  and <B><I>information content</I></B>  of  a 
message  are  not  necessarily the same. Explain what is  meant  by  the 
<B><I>entropy</I></B>  of a message source. [3 marks]
<p>
<li>
Explain what is meant by a <B><I>variable length code</I></B>. Outline in your answer 
why  a  variable  length  code might provide a  more  efficient  set  of 
codewords for an alphabet of symbols than a <B><I>fixed length code</I></B>. [5 marks]
<p>
<LI>
An alphabet consists of 7 symbols A to G inclusive.  The letter A occurs 
with  probability  6/16, both B and C occur with probability  3/16,  the 
remainder all have probability 1/16.
<p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
What  is the minimum codeword size possible using a <B><I>fixed length  binary 
coding</I></B>? [2 marks] 
<p>

Huffman code developed in part (ii). [4 marks]
</ol>
<p>
<LI>
Many   compression  algorithms  used  for  video  encoding  succeed   in 
compressing  a  data source far below the theoretical  limit  calculated 
from its entropy.
<P>
<ol type="i">
<li>
Why is this possible? [4 marks]
<p>
<li>

given by the entropy?  Give reasons for your answers. [5 marks]
