Calculators are permitted, provided they are silent, self powered and do 
not contain any stored programs or data.  Calculators are allowed at the 
discretion of the invigilators and must be available  for inspection  if 
required.

The diagram below  shows a robot navigation  problem.  The mobile  robot 
occupies  one of the unshaded  squares and can move to any of  the  four 
adjacent  squares  but  must avoid the shaded squares  (walls)  and  the 
boundaries.   The aim of the robot is to find a path to the goal,  which 
may be anywhere in the grid.

<OL type="a">
<li>
Assume that the robot always starts at the top left corner but the  goal 
and  walls   may take different configurations.   What  blind  searching 
method  would you recommend for finding (i) any path to the   goal,  and 
(ii)  the  shortest  path  to the goal?  You  should  explain  how  such 
searching would work for the  problem above. [10]
<P>
<li>
Now assume a radio beacon is attached to the  goal and the robot can 
sense  the  strength  of  the  signal.   The  signal  varies  in  direct  
proportion  to distance from the beacon and is completely unaffected  by 
the walls.  How would you design a heuristic search for the path  finding 
task?   Explain how your method  would  operate for the  above  problem. 
[14]
<p>
<li>
Genetic  algorithms  can  be  seen as a kind  of  search.   Compare  and 
contrast blind search methods with genetic algorithms for this  problem.

production rule architecture. [8]

<B>(b)</B> Outline an algorithm for rule matching and use it to produce a trace 
of the operation of the example system below.  The  operators <B>+</B>, <B>-</B> and <B>*</B>

"negative" are provided by the system. [16]

     & (zero ?y)         -->       print ?x, print ?p,
                                   erase (value ?x ?p).

                                   assert (count ?y (- ?y 1)).
