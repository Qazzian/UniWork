  <LI>The diagram below shows a robot navigation problem. The mobile robot 
  occupies one of the unshaded squares and can move to any of the four adjacent 
  squares but must avoid the shaded squares (walls) and the boundaries. The aim 
  of the robot is to find a path to the goal, which may be anywhere in the grid. 
  <IMG src="CS26210 Artificial Intelligence Concepts_files/cst1.jpg"> 
  <OL type=a>
    <LI>Assume that the robot always starts at the top left corner but the goal 
    and walls may take different configurations. What blind searching method 
    would you recommend for finding (i) any path to the goal, and (ii) the 
    shortest path to the goal? You should explain how such searching would work 
    for the problem above. [10] 
    <P></P>
    <LI>Now assume a radio beacon is attached to the goal and the robot can 
    sense the strength of the signal. The signal varies in direct proportion to 
    distance from the beacon and is completely unaffected by the walls. How 
    would you design a heuristic search for the path finding task? Explain how 
    your method would operate for the above problem. [14] 
    <P></P>
    <LI>Genetic algorithms can be seen as a kind of search. Compare and contrast 
    blind search methods with genetic algorithms for this problem. [9] </LI></OL>

  "zero" and "negative" are provided by the system. [16]
