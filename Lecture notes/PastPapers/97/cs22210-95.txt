   Answer THREE questions

   1. Explain   what  is  meant   by   the   EXCLUSION   PROBLEM   for  
      cooperating   processes.  Give  an  example  to show how  things 
      can go wrong.                                                [6]

   Why are exclusion problems difficult to detect and correct?     [6]

   Define  the operations of an integer  semaphore  which  allows   no  
   more   than   N   processes   to  be   in  their  critical  section 
   simultaneously.                                                 [6]

   Suppose  that there are two processes. STACKER and UNSTACKER,  that 
   are adding to and removing from (respectively) a stack. Show how to 
   use  integer  semaphores  to control the  processes   STACKER   and  
   UNSTACKER so  that  the  stack  never  exceeds  a  given  size  and  
   there  is no attempt to remove an object from the stack when it  is 
   empty.                                                         [15]

   2. What  are the advantages of incorporating multi-process  control 
      within  a programming language?                              [6]

   Describe  the synchronisation facilities available within  the  Ada 
   programming language.                                          [13]

   Suppose that, within an Ada program, an array (of a given size)  is 
   used as a cyclic buffer.  Tasks can write elements into the  buffer 
   and  read elements  from  the  buffer  by  calling  entries  in   a 
   buffer task.  Sketch the code of the buffer task.              [14]


   3. Provide an outline description of the structure and function  of 
      the inode in UNIX.                                          [16]

      Discuss  the design decisions which lie behind the  inode  based 
      mechanism.                                                  [17]

   4. Explain  the concept of virtual memory management  and  describe 
      its potential advantages.                                   [16]

      Discuss  the  costs associated with a segmentation  with  paging 
      virtual  memory management scheme.  Outline ways in which  these 
      costs can be reduced.                                       [17]
   5. List and explain the conditions necessary for the development of 
      deadlock.                                                   [11]

      Explain  the  potential  options  for  preventing  deadlock  and 
      discuss their costs and drawbacks.                          [12]

      Carefully  describe the potential for deadlock in the  following 
      Ada  code.  Outline a modification to remove  this  possibility.  
      Does the modified code have any remaining potential drawbacks?
                                                                 [10]
       procedure P is
         Tl_WANTS_ENTRY  :  BOOLEAN := FALSE;
         T2_WANTS_ENTRY  :  BOOLEAN := FALSE;

        procedure T1_CRITICAL is separate;
        procedure T2_CRITICAL is separate;

        task T1;

        task body T1 is
        begin
           loop
              Tl_WANTS_ENTRY := TRUE;
              while T2_WANTS_ENTRY loop
                 null;
              end loop;
              T1_CRITICAL;
              T1_WANTS_ENTRY := FALSE;
              -- other activities
              end loop;
           end T1;

           task T2;

           task body T2 is
           begin
              loop
                 T2_WANTS_ENTRY := TRUE;
                 while T1_WANTS_ENTRY loop
                    null;
                 end loop;
                 T2_CRITICAL;
                 T2_WANTS_ENTRY := FALSE;
                 -- other activities
               end loop;
            end T2;

         begin
            null;
         end P;
