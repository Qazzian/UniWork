Using the <b>NewsPaper</b> class presented in question 3, produce a Java 
class  <b>NewsPaperList</b> which will support a collection of up to  30 
different newspapers. <br>
In addition to any declarations, you should also provide the code to:
<table>
<tr>
<td width=5%><B>i.</B></td>
<td> create a NewsPaperList</td>
<td align=right>(3)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><B>ii.</B></td>
<td> add a newspaper to the list</td>
<td align=right> (5)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><B>iii.</B></td>
<td> remove a newspaper, identified by name</td>
<td align=right>(8)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><B>iv.</B></td>
<td> return the total number of newspapers in the list</td>
<td align=right> (2)</td>
</tr>

Assuming  that  the  NewsAgency  described  in  question  3  also  sells 
magazines,  it would have probably been much better to describe a  class 
<b>Publication</b>  that is then extended to form  <b>NewsPaper</b>  and 
<b>Magazine</b>.

Nelly  owns  a NewAgency and has asked you to take  on  the  financially 
rewarding task of computerising her delivery system.<br>
Nelly  stocks  about  25  different types  of  newspaper.  She  has  240 
customers  but  only 80 of these have home deliveries. The rest  of  her 
customers pick up their papers on the way to work.
<P> 
You  have  researched  the  problem  and  have  gathered  the  following 
information:<br>
<b>Newspaper</b>: (title, price, daily, Sunday)
<b>Customer</b>: (name, address, currentBill, homeDelivery)
