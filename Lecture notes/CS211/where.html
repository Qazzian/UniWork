<h1> Program Design, Data Structures and Algorithms - progress</h1>
A report on what we are doing and when:
<h2>First Semester</h2>

<ul>
<li>Monday October 16th: 
<ul> 
<li> we started Linked Lists. Will finish them on Friday.
<li> I have handed out the first assignment - worth 30% of your mark. Due Nov 24th.
</ul>
<li> Thursday October 19th - changes in pracs!!!
<ul>
<li>you should be working on your unix prac 1 (weeks
        ending Oct 13th and Oct 20th). Must be signed off by Oct 27th.
 <li>   Then do unix prac2. Should be signed off by Nov 9th.
 <li> Then the first data struct prac,
 prac1 which is about queues in next 1-2 weeks. Should be signed off by Nov 16th.

    <li> Next is prac2 which should be signed off by Nov 30th. Remember you also always have your assignment!

    </ul>
    <li> 19/11/00: You did some stuff with Andy Starr and then me about complexity. 
We are currently doing recursion and will soon start trees. 
The last practical of the term that needs signing off is on recursion (by the end of term). 
That gives you a free week. You might want to play with trees - but I'll start next term with 
a prac on that.
<li> End of Term:  We have got half way through 'more trees'. The slides are better than the word notes. 
<ul>
<li> Your pracs should all be done by end of term.
<li>Also note the code
for AVL trees is in 'AVL.doc' just for fun.
<li>There are some sample exam type questions
for anyone with time on their hands in the notes directory.
<li>We'll finish with Trees and JTrees in February and then
ffl will be telling you about graphs.
<li>Sunny Solstice!!!
</ul>

    </ul>

<h2> Second Semester </h2>
<ul>
<li> Finished trees and moretrees
<li> ffl lectured on graphs
<li> 9/3/01 started sorting
<li> 19/3/01 Tables - next BTrees<
<li> on 6/4 ffl will be around to answer questions
<li> after the break I will do a real quick dash through stringsand P and NP  and then ffl will do greedy algorithms. I'll 
discuss the last assignment in an extra lecture.
</ul>
