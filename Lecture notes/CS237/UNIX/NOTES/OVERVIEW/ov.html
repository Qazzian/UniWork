<h3>Introduction</h3>

This part of CS23710 is intended to give a grounding in 
the Unix operating system and Unix systems
programming. It builds on CS22210 (Operating Systems), and supports
the study of Telematics/Communications.

<p>
This course focuses on the POSIX standards, 
as supported by Solaris 8, the version of Unix you will use in 
your practical sessions.
When using any Unix system call or library function on Solaris the
definition for the command can always be found using the <b>man</b> command.

<p>
These notes give a brief history of Unix, and cover the Unix man pages, 
the Unix file system, the Unix process system and single 
machine inter-process communication.

<h3>The history of Unix</h3>

In 1969, after ending their involvement with the development of
the Multics operating system, members of the Computing Science
Research Centre at Bell Labs, part of AT&T, the American Telephone
company, were left without <i>a convenient interactive computing service</i>
<a href="../references.html#BACH86">[BACH86]</a>.

<p>
The part of the Bell team that worked on Multics are credited with
the development of the first version's of Unix. The team consisted of:

<ul>
<li> Dennis Ritchie
<li> Ken Thompson
<li> Brian Kernighan
</ul>

<p>
One of the major problems the team had at this time was that they
could not play the game of space travel on the Honeywell machine they
had running the GECOS operating system, as it was too difficult to
control the ship, and the system was to slow for this kind of
interactive use.

<p>
Having acquired a DEC PDP-7 which provide good performance and
graphics display Thompson and Ritchie implemented the first version of Unix
written in assembler, and also wrote space travel for the PDP-7. The
most notable feature for its time was the innovative filesystem.
Brian Kernighan coined the name Unix as a pun on Multics (castrated
Multics).

<p>
Unix was first used outside its initial development team for a
text-processing system in the patent department of Bell Labs, and its
use spread within AT&T.

<p>
In about 1971 Thompson set out to write a Fortran compiler for the
Unix system but came up with a new language called B, (influenced by
BCPL). This was an interpreted language and therefore had a
significant performance drawback, Ritchie developed it further into a other
new language called C.

<p>
Unix was then rewritten in C. Writing operating systems in a high(ish)
level language  was an
unheard of step at that time, but it had a great effect on how well
Unix was going to accepted among outside users. The early development
of Unix and C are strongly linked, a link which persists today.

<p>
AT&T, being a government body, could not market computer
products at this time, and so it provided Unix free to universities for
research and educational purposes. This exposure at university level brought
Unix into the commercial world via the students that "grew up using
Unix".

<p>
The popularity of Unix grew, with ports to machines other than the PDP
class of machines, and the evolution of Unix was both within and outside of
Bell Labs. Official support by AT&T was first announced in 1983. This was
for the System V version of Unix.

<p>
The most notable variant of Unix is that produced by the University of
California at Berkeley. This is called BSD Unix (Berkeley System
Distribution) and was seminal in extending the At&T Unix with
networking extensions such as sockets (not covered by this course).
Many of the innovations made by Berkeley were incorporated
into the AT&T release of Unix called System V, Release 2. Sun, and all other
major Unix vendors, have moved to make their Unix operating system interfaces
conform to System V, Release 4 (SVR4). They then add value to this basic
common interface and to the underlying operating system (e.g. threads).

<p>
Unix continues to evolve with support of multiprocessing, improved
communications and  distributed objects for example.
Many believe that Unix will be around in 20 years time and will have evolved as much as
it has in the last 20 years.

<h3>Why Unix is important</h3>

<blockquote>
...Whatever happens, the time spent learning Unix systems by
serious students of operating systems will surely be worthwhile
<a href="../references.html#DET90">[DET90]</a>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Any vendor who claims to be involved with <em>open systems</em> should
have Unix as a central feature of their tool repertoire (what is the definition
of an open system?). Unix is the only operating system to
cover the range of machines from PC's to mainframes, and all levels in
between.

<p>
Unix is supplied by a large number of vendors and is therefore vendor
independent. Consequently, buyers can base their I.T. strategy on Unix, knowing
that they are not tied into a single vendor's products.

<p>
Some of the major variants of Unix conform to standards such as the IEEE POSIX
standard, or facilitate the use and development of POSIX compliant
programs. Since Unix has an open systems philosophy, interoperability
between different vendors' machines of different architectures, 
operating systems and communications mechanisms is a central theme and
becoming much more important.

<p>
Other Operating Systems (e.g. OpenVMS, the POSIX subsystem of
Windows NT) claim to use the same standard programming interface as SVR4.

<hr>
<a name="shell"></a>
<h3>The Shell</h3>

Much of what would be programmed using high level languages such as C
or Fortran in other operating systems can be done in the Unix command
language or shell. Examples are sh, csh, bash or ksh.

<p>
The shell is a command line interpreter and runs like any other application
program in that it is serviced by the Unix kernel. 
An executing shell is a process that takes the command line a user types,
breaks it up into its constituent commands and arguments, and then
<em>forks</em> 
a child process. The executable
file (command) is then loaded into the child's address space and given
the appropriate arguments.

<p>
The parent waits until the child terminates
with the <em>exit</em> system call. The parent will then again display the shell
prompt. Each parent and child is a separate process. This is discussed in
more detail in the <a href="../process/process.html#creating">process notes</a>.

<pre>
for(;;)  /* forever */
  {
    /* fork creates a child process */
    /* fork return 0 to the child */
    /* fork returns the process id of the child to the parent */
    if (fork() == 0)
        /* execl overlays a copy of a program on the child */
        /* only the child executes */
        execl(command, command, arg1, arg2, 0);
    wait((int *) 0);  /* parent waits */
}
</pre>

<p>
When a command is placed in the background using <em>&</em>, the shell
parent process does not wait for the child to exit. Some shells also have 
built-in commands such as <em>cd</em> and <em>echo</em> which do not 
create child processes.

<pre>
write (17, "void:cmk>", 9) = 9
read (16, "ls\n", 1024) = 3
pipe (0xf7fff560) = 0
vfork () = 15684
wait4 (0, 0xf7ffe98c, 0x3, 0xf7ffe944) = 15684
wait4 (0, 0xf7ffe98c, 0x3, 0xf7ffe944) = 0
write (17, "void:cmk>", 9) = 9
read (16, "pwd\n", 1024) = 4
write (1, "/a/athene/4.2/xy1e/cmk/teach/C23".., 41) = 41
</pre>

<p>
The above is derived from running the command <em>truss csh</em>
and then typing <em>ls</em>. It gives a listing of the system
calls made by <em>csh</em> when it receives the <em>ls</em> command from
the user. The interpretation of the above is:

<ul>
<li> Write prompt void:cmk>
<li> Read in command <em>ls</em>
<li> Create a pipe
<li> Fork a child process
<li> Wait for child
<li> Child has returned
<li> Write prompt
<li> Read command pwd which is internal to csh
<li> Write out result
</ul>

<hr>
<a name="structure"></a>
<h3>The structure of Unix</h3>

The Unix operating system is made up of a number of software components:

<ul>
<li> The Kernel (composed of the file system, process system and device drivers).
<li> Utility programs.
<li> Object code libraries.
</ul>

<hr>
<a name="kernel"></a>
<h4>The Kernel</h4>

The principal business of the kernel is to manage concurrent processes. 
All actions, memory management, inter-process communication and scheduling 
of processes
and resources are directed via or initiated by the kernel.  
The kernel runs as a system process
during the whole time the machine is up and working. It stays in
memory (can not be swapped out).  The kernel
contains various data structures which represent processes
files, file systems and communications.
 
<p>
The kernel executable is in a file called <em>genunix</em> or sometimes
<em>unix</em> in the directory /kernel. 

<pre>
marilyn.dcs.aber.ac.uk 16 > ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys       876960 Oct 17 19:39 genunix
</pre>

<img src="../../gif/unix_structure.gif" alt="The Kernel" align=middle border=1>

<hr>
<a name="drivers"></a>
<h4>Device drivers</h4>

Device drivers are the part of the kernel through which the format of
communication to and from hardware is translated. A device driver is
rather like a compiler or interpreter; it has a uniform front-end
and potentially many back-ends, one for each kind of device to be
"driven". The device driver will then map front-end requests made by the
kernel to device-specific commands (often complex sequences of control characters).
This insulates the kernel from the underlying hardware and makes it easy to
substitute one device with another. 

<p>
Devices are accessed via special files which by convention are located
in /devices and its subdirectories (or via symbolic links from /dev).
Devices drivers can be of two types:

<ol>
<li> Block drivers - disks, tapes.
<li> Character drivers - terminals, printers, networks.
</ol>

<hr>
<a name="filesystem"></a>
<h4>File system</h4>

The Unix file system organises files as a hierarchy, or tree structure.
The file system may be composed of files and directories
from local or remote machines. Operations on all parts of the
file system are though the standard primitives such as <em>open, read,
write, lseek, unlink</em> and <em>close</em> which access the file system
through appropriate device drivers.

<p>
Remote file system access is achieved via a communication protocol such as
NFS (Sun's Networked File System) or RFS (Remote File System). These protocols
are usually implemented as part of the kernel, such that the kernel can,
if appropriate, intercept system calls meant for remote files and forward the
requests to be handle by the remote file system. The important point to note
is that this underlying communication is (apart from some performance degradation)
transparent and the remote file system appears to be local.

<hr>
<a name="utility"></a>
<h4>Utility programs</h4>

These are programs such as <em>ls, cc, make, vi</em> that have been
implemented outside the kernel, but are still part of the Operating
System. The system utilities are found in directories such as:

<ul>
<li> /usr/bin
<li> /bin
<li> /usr/ucb
<li> /usr/5bin
</ul>

<p>
This is in contrast to local software which can be put anywhere. The
support group by convention put local non-system software such as <em>X Window 
System, latex, poplog</em> in /usr/local/bin.

<p>
A typical search path would be:

<pre>
marilyn.dcs.aber.ac.uk 32 > echo $path
/bin /usr/bin /usr/local/X11R5/bin /usr/5bin /usr/ucb /usr/local/bin  /usr/openwin/bin
/usr/local/gnu/bin /usr/local/etc .
</pre>

<p>
Why is the . at the end of the path?

<hr>
<a name="libraries"></a>
<h4>Object code libraries</h4>

An object code library consists of a collection of functions in one file
that can be linked
either statically at link time or dynamically when an executable 
runs. The system libraries can be accessed in /usr/lib and /lib.
Local libaries (such as X libraries) on computer science machines are
located in /usr/local/lib. 

<hr>
<a name="process"></a>
<h4>The process system</h4>

A process is a potentially 
executing program that the kernel manages along with
many other processes that are either created by users or by the operating
system. The process may either be resident in physical memory or be temporarily 
swapped out onto disk. Unix is a multi-tasking (or timesharing) 
operating system, in that many 
processes will be present (though not
necessarily executing) at any one time; this contrasts with single-tasking
operating systems such as DOS, although Windows/NT is multi-tasking.

<h5>The process environment</h5>

A process' environment consists of the following regions:

<ul>
<li> Text (the program code) - reentrant code or unmodifiable data.
<li> Data region - modifiable, region of memory often called the heap and acquired using
     functions such as <em>malloc</em>.
<li> Stack region - Process stack, i.e. where your program functions and local variables
     get created during a function call.
<li> Register contents, Process priority, list of open files.
</ul>

<p>
Each process has its own address space (memory) which is protected from use
by other processes. If a number of processes are executing the same
program then only one copy of that program is stored in primary memory, but
is accessed by all the processes using it which have separate process states (stack,
data regions, register contents, process priority information and file handles). Such
reusable code is known as reentrant code (several processes potentially reading the code
at the same time). 

<h5>The system call</h5>

A process communicates with the rest of the operating system via system calls.
A system call is a request to the kernel to furnish that process with
a service. When a process uses a system call it switches from
executing in user mode, to executing in kernel mode (called a <em>mode switch</em>).
The kernel saves enough information about the process
it was executing in user mode so that it can return to execute the
process again in user mode once it has finished executing the system
call in kernel mode.

<p>
The kernel mode and user mode of a process have separate stacks.
The context switch enables a process to use the functions and data
of the kernel. The kernel can access sensitive data structures and execute
operations that user mode processes can not. For example, the
kernel can access devices directly (using its device drivers).

<p>
A context switch, since it involves saving and restoring a process's
context, is a relatively slow operation and forms a major Unix operating system
performance overhead. 

<p>
The use of <em>truss(1)</em> shows the systems calls within a program that
involve context switches in a program while it is executing. This can
be used for debugging a program. An example of using <em>truss</em>
on the <em>echo</em> command is given below. It illustrates how "expensive"
even a simple command is in terms of context switches.

<pre>
marilyn.dcs.aber.ac.uk 36 > truss /bin/echo "hello world"
execve("/bin/echo", 0xEFFFECF0, 0xEFFFECFC)  argc = 2
open("/dev/zero", O_RDONLY)                     = 3

open("/usr/lib/libdl.so.1", O_RDONLY)           = 4
fstat(4, 0xEFFFE9AC)                            = 0

ioctl(1, TCGETA, 0xEFFFEA6C)                    = 0
ioctl(1, TCGETA, 0xEFFFEA6C)                    = 0

write(1, " h e l l o   w o r l d\n", 12)        = 12
lseek(0, 0, SEEK_CUR)                           = 203498
_exit(0)
</pre>

<p>
Each process has an entry in the kernel process state table, and each
process is allocated a U-AREA that contains private data, that can only be accessed
by the kernel and the process when executing in kernel mode.

<h5>Process states</h5>
 
The kernel schedules which process runs and when. The possible states
for a process are:

<ol>
<li> Running:
<ul>
<li> Executing in user mode.
<li> Executing in kernel mode.
</ul>
<li> Ready: Not executing but ready to run as soon as scheduled to do so.
<li> Blocked: It can no longer execute, e.g. waiting for I/O.
</ol>

<p>
There are several utility programs that provide information on process
states. Two of the most important are <em>ps</em> and <em>vmstat</em>.

ps provides a snap shot of the processes and their states. <em>ps -el</em>
shows all processes and their states on a machines at that instant:

<pre>

<p>
The first useful column (column S) indicates the state of the process:

<table>
<tr>
<td>0 </td> <td>Process is running on a processor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>S </td> <td>Sleeping: process is waiting for an event to complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>R </td> <td>Runnable: process is on run queue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Z </td> <td>Zombie  state:  process  terminated and parent not waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>T </td> <td>Process is stopped, either by a job control  signal  or  because  it is
                being traced.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The PPID is the parent process UID. PRI is the priority of the process where
higher numbers equal lower priority. NI is the <em>nice</em> value which is
used to determine priority (see notes 
on <a href="../process/process.html#scheduling">process system</a>). SZ is the
size (in pages) of swappable process's image in main memory. TTY is the controlling
terminal (if one exists). Finally, TIME is the cumulative elapsed time since the
process was started.

<p>
The <em>vmstat</em> command delves into the system and normally reports certain
statistics kept about processes, virtual memory, disk, kernel trap and
CPU activity.

<p>
Without options, <em>vmstat</em> displays a one-line summary of the virtual
memory activity since the system was booted. With a numeric
argument <em>vmstat</em> displays the statistics about the system every <em>n</em>
seconds:

</pre>

<p>
Both <em>vmstat</em> and <em>ps</em> read various kernel data
structures such as the U-AREA to gain the information they need.

<h5>Differences between  system calls and library calls</h5>

A library call does not involve a kernel mode switch; all the data and
operations required can be done in user-space. A library call may however use system
calls which do involve context switches. The library calls are intended to
provide a more convenient programming interface to system calls. Examples of
library calls are found in section 3 of <em>man</em> pages and system calls
in section 2. 

(Notice the terminology used here; to be absolutely strict, POSIX defines
a library interface to a set of system calls.  In Unix these library
functions are described in section 2 of the man pages, and are often
called `system calls' or `chapter 2 functions').

<p>
Overall, library routines (chapter 3 routines) tend to be more readable 
and easier to use than system calls (chapter 2 routines).  
However, system calls give more control and often better performance and 
can perform tasks for which library calls do not exist. 

<h5>The Process in summary (the bits worth saying twice)</h5>

The process can be summed up as an executing program initiated by
either the user or the system. The kernel scheduler determines how
it should be executed in relation to other, competing processes.

<p>
A process obtains services from the kernel via system calls, which
change the context within which the process runs from user to kernel
mode. This enables the process to access kernel functions and data
structure.

<h4>The Terminal</h4>

The terminal is a class of device which can be accessed via the same
generic device driver interface which is, in turn made visible to
user programs via the <em>ioctl</em> system call. Examples of terminals are:

<ul>
<li> communication ports
<li> pseudo-terminals
</ul>

Terminals like any other Unix device are accessed via special files in
/dev. Terminals will be discussed in more detail during lectures.

<h3>Some other Unix-style operating systems</h3>

<h4>Plan9</h4>

The film <em>Plan9 from outer space</em> starring amongst others, Boris Carloff,
received the Golden Turkey award for the worst film of all time. 

<p>
Having had the development of Unix taken out of the original Unix
developers hands, the original development team noticed that
the original beauty and conciseness of Unix had been lost. 
In an attempt to recapture this, they wrote a new operating system which,
though like Unix, is much smaller and faster and takes the concept of
<em>everything is a file</em> further.

<p>
The Plan9 project had both a software and hardware component, the
software involved the construction of an operating system that would
make use of a file server and a CPU server that are separate machines,
connected by a fast communication bus.

<p>
The hardware component was  a terminal called the GNOT that is MC68020
based, and appears to be a halfway house between an X-terminal and a
traditional low end workstation, in that it handles clients such as a
window manager, but is not intended to be used for tasks such compilation.
 
<p>
A senior management directive at Bell Labs stated that all projects
must have names. This statement came the day after the team had watched
the film, and so called the project <em>Plan9 from Bell Labs</em>. Plan9
remains a research vehicle.

<h4>MACH</h4>

MACH is a development of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) which has
taken the BSD derivative of Unix and rewritten substantial parts in an
attempt to create a unixoid operating system that has support for both
running on, and programming multi-processor machines. A central part
of MACH is the concept of multi-threading which involves the creation
and communication of multiple processes that share address space
without the overhead of the traditional Unix process and interprocess
communication. The MACH has what is known as a micro-kernel, or minimal kernel.
Most of the functionality provided by conventional Unix kernels is instead 
executed in user address space. This cuts down on context switch overheads.
OSF/1 (one of the operating systems used by DEC) had a
MACH micro-kernel architecture.

<h4>Linux</h4>

Linux is an open-source Unix-type operating system available under the
GNU Public License.  Linux conforms to
the POSIX 1003.1 standard, and includes much of the functionality of
Unix System V and BSD 4.3.  
<p>
Originally developed by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student of Computer
Science, Linux is now used by Universities, software houses, Internet providers and
private individuals.
<p>
Linux runs on Amigas, PCs and DEC Alpha workstations.  It supports any
readily available Unix software.   It also runs on multi-processor
architectures (like our Beowulf clusters).
<p>
The Linux kernel supports preemptive multi-tasking.
It is highly effective in memory use, supporting paging with copy-on-write
and dynamic cache for hard disk.  
<p>
Linux supports a variety of file systems, including Ext2, MS-DOS, VFAT
and many others.   Linux can also be integrated into local Unix networks.
