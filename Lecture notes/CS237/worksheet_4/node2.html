The Problem - Part One</A>
</H1>
<P>
A tri-athlon competition consists of three components, a cycling
race, a swim and a final running race. The winner
of the competition is the one with the shortest total time
for the three races.
<P>
This part is identical to part one from last week,
but this time you are REQUIRED to use an appropriately
specified structure to hold the values being processed by your program.
The structure should have a field to hold the competitor's
name, a field to hold the cycling race time in seconds, another to
hold the swimming race time in seconds, another to hold
the running race time in seconds and a final field to hold the total
time in seconds.
<P>
Write a program to calculate the total time for a single competitor.
<P>
Your input should consist of ten items. Firstly, the name
of the competitor on a single line; this should not
include any ``white space'', use underscore to provide
gaps in the name. A second line of input
should provide three integers representing the competitor's
time for the cycle race in hours, minutes and seconds.
A third line of input should provide the competitor's time
for the swim in the same format.
A fourth line of input should provide the competitor's time
for the final running race in the same format.
<P>
The user should be provided with a prompt for each line
of input expected.
<P>
An example of the input, together with the prompts is:
<P>
Competitor's name: Fred_Bloggs
<BR>
Time for cycle race (hours minutes seconds): 1 35 47
<BR>
Time for the swim (hours minutes seconds): 1 29 23
<BR>
Time for the running race (hours minutes seconds): 1 05 14
<BR>
<P>
The program output should be the competitors name and total time
in the format shown below.
<P>
Competitor Fred_Bloggs has a total time of 3Hrs 5Mins 10Secs.
<P>
Your input and output should be in EXACTLY the format
given above.
<P>
Don't forget your previous lectures (in other modules) on algorithm design. Before you
start to tackle any computer program, write down a solution on paper,
carry out a pencil and paper test, revise the algorithm
if necessary. Only when you are happy that you have a working algorithm
should you start to write the code.
