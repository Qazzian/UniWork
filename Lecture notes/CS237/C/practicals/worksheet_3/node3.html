<P>
You are now required to extend your program to cope
with a group of competitors. The program should now request
an initial extra item of data before commencing, namely,
the number of competitors in the competition. You should
provide a prompt requesting this information which
the user should supply as an integer.
<P>
An example might be:
<P>
How many competitors are in the competition?: 10
<P>
Your program should now loop through the number
indicated, requesting the data for each competitor and printing
out their total time etc. in the format specified in part one.
<P>
Your program should also keep a record of the slowest and fastest
competitors including their names and total times.
<P>
When the data for all the competitors has been provided, your program
should then print out the names and times of the fastest and
slowest competitors.
<P>
Don't forget the earlier remark about designing first and don't
forget to use meaningful variable names and comments.
<P>
