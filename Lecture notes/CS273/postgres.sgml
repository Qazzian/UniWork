    <simpara>Postgres is an object-relational database management
system. We will, initially, use only the subset of its facilities
which make it appear to be a relational DBMS. It is public domain and
open source.</simpara>
    <simpara>The Department of Computer Science manages an
installation of Postgres on one of its Sun machines. The hostname of
this machine is <command>database.dcs.aber.ac.uk</command> and it can
be accessed via a variety of mechanisms including ODBC, JDBC, a command
line interpreter (monitor) called <command>psql</command> and a simple
GUI called <command>pgaccess</command>.</simpara>
    <simpara>Full documentation for Postgres and its local
installation can be found on the Department's <ulink
url="http://www.dcs.aber.ac.uk/support/software/postgres/index.html">web.
    </ulink>
These pages are maintained by the <ulink
url="http://www.dcs.aber.ac.uk/support/">support group. </ulink> You
should seek help and examples here for using <command>psql</command>
or <command>pgaccess</command> for testing; the JDBC interface and
individual SQL statements. Note that many SQL statements have minor
extensions to or variations from any SQL standard.</simpara>
    <simpara>For an understanding of later sections of this document,
it is necessary to know that <command>psql</command> can receive
both SQL statement and <emphasis>psql commands</emphasis>. These
latter are preceded by a backslash. They provide database listing
operations and interaction with the operating system. See the <ulink
url="http://www.dcs.aber.ac.uk/support/manuals/postgres/misc/psql.html">on-line
manual </ulink> for details.</simpara>

    <blockquote>
      <simpara><emphasis>The following description is a simplification of
  full Postgres facilities, reflecting the local installation
  decisions.</emphasis></simpara>
    </blockquote>
    <simpara>Users must be registered under Postgres. Each user has as
  many databases as they require. Each database has a password. (Note
  that users do not therefore have passwords directly.) New users and
  new databases must be created by the system administrator. Users
  cannot create their own databases. Tables in one database cannot be
  accessed from another database.</simpara>
    <simpara>Each student registered for CS27310 has been registered.
Each has had one database created. Its name is the same as the
student's UID. Student's passwords are the same as their UNIX
passwords.</simpara>
    <simpara>The databases have no content.</simpara>
