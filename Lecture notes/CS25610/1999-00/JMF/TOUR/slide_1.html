The JMF is capable of processing a large number of type of
streaming media.

<UL>
<li>Content Type
<p>The term content type is used to describe the
overall format in which the media data is stored.
In many cases this translates to file type.

For instance "AVI" and "QuickTime" are both
content types.
<p>
<li>media stream
<p> A media stream may be obtained from a file
or received over the network.
<p>
<li>track
<p>A media stream may contain more than one track of media.
It's quite common for audio to be carried in one track
and video in a second track.
<p>A track's type describes the sort of data in contain
and a track's format defines how the data is structured.
<p>
<li>media stream delivery
<p>
<ul>
<li>pull
<p> A pull data source is completely controlled by the client.
<p>
<li>push
<p> A push data source is controlled by the server.
</ul>
<p>
<li> media presentation
<p>
Time based media can be presented via devices such as speakers and screens
to the user or can be sent to files for storage or transmitted across
the network for reception elsewhere.
<p>The term <strong>renderer</strong> is used as a generic
term to describe the abstraction of a presentation device.
<p>
<li>presentation controls
<p>Most players have some ability for the user to control
the presentation. This might be via controls similar
to those on a domestic VCR.
<p><li>latency
<p> Latency is a particularly important factor when processing
time based media. Latency may be due to delay in media crossing
a network, being recovered by a file or may occur simply because
of processing delays within software.
<p><li>presentation quality
<p>Presentation quality is dependent on many factors.
The quality of devices presenting material will clearly have an effect as well
as the inherent quality of the media arriving. Bandwidth available
on links will also have an effect as will factors such as loss.
<p><li>media processing
<p>The JMF provides several mechanisms to enable the user
to process the media streams.
<ul>
<li> Data can be multiplexed into complex
streams,<li> codecs perform (de)coding and (de)compression,<li> filters
can add special effects.
<li>Compositors combine multiple tracks onto one presentation device. An
example might be the overlaying of Welsh translation sub-titles onto the video
of an English language movie.
</ul>
<p>
<li>media capture
<p>JMF supports media capture via a variety of devices.
<ul>
<p>
<li>type
<br>
Media capture devices can be of the <strong>pull</strong>
or <strong>push</strong> variety.
<p>
<li>controls
<br>It is normal for controls to provide provided
to manage the capture devices.
</ul>
