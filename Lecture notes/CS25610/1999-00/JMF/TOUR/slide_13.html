Most methods available on a player are
only available in certain states and
cause exceptions to be raised in invoked
while the player is in an inappropriate state.
<p>
Events are raised as players move between states.
Most methods that request a player to move
between states act asynchronously. That is, the method
call will return <strong>before</strong> the player
has changed state. One must wait for events to
know that a state transition has occured.
