The components of the task</A>
</H2>
<P>
Overall you have three subtasks to complete
<P><UL>
<LI> The Web Pages
<P>
The Applet you produce should run within a web page
using the Netscape browsers on the Intel machines
running Solaris in the Solarium.
<P>
To begin with, you can embed the Applet of a simple, single web page.
<P>
However, another component of the practical is intended to gain
practice using ``Frames&quot; on web pages and via them understand
some extra features available to Java Applets.
<P>
If you have never used Frames before, then at the end of this worksheet
I give a simple example of a ``top&quot; web page which includes
as its sole contents two frames.
<P>
The eventual idea for your web pages is as follows
<P><UL>
<LI> top level
<P>
At the top level you have a web page which includes
two frames, each loaded from separate web pages.
One of the web pages which is loaded into one of the frames
should be a simple straightforward web page. The second
web page, loaded into the second frame, should not
be a simple web page, but should itself be a page
which contains two more frames.
<LI> lower level
<P>
The lower level page mentioned above which itself
includes two frames should be constructed
as follows. One of its two frames should
again be a simple web page, the second of the frames
should be the one into which your Java Applet is loaded.
<LI> Examples
<P>
The screen shot of my application included at the end
of this worksheet is precisely constructed in the
way described above.
<P><UL>
<LI> my top level web page
<P>
My top level page merely includes commands to
indicate that it has two frames. Into those frames
I load the web page which starts
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
``This frame is the upper one...&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
and the second area which contains all of the rest
of the displayed material. The web page I immediately
load contains just another specification for a page
which itself loads two frames.
<LI> my embedded frames
<P>
The lower part of my display therefore includes 
the two frames which contain the words
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
``Computer Science, Prifysgol ....&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
and the words
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
``Dave Price's Applet test page.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> the applet page
<P>
The last page mentioned above includes the appropriate
commands to embed the Applet. You will find these
in your lecture notes. However, to be helpful
I've included a simple example at the end
of this document.
</UL></UL>
<LI> The Java Applet
<P>
Your Java Applet should be written using various facilities
available to applets as well as general AWT facilities.
<P>
The applet visual interface has four main areas.
<P><UL>
<LI> File Selection
<P>
One area, at the top in my Applet, allows
the user to type in the final components of
the URL that references some information the user
would like to load. In my tests, I have allowed the user
to enter the name of plain text files, html
pages, images in the form of gif files, names of
directories and audio clips in the form of ``.au&quot;
files. All url endings specified by the user
are assumed to be relative to the <EM>documentbase </EM>
from which the web page was loaded.
<LI> Selection of Window For Display
<P>
This part of my interface is displayed towards the left
on my GUI.
<P>
Applets are allowed to interact with the browser in
which they are running via an AppletContext interface.
An applet can get hold of its AppletContext by calling
the method <EM>getAppletContext()</EM>.
<P>
One particular
method available via the AppletContext is that you can request
your hosting browser to open and display other material
reached via a URL. When you ask the browser to
do this for you, there is a facility to indicate
in which ``browser window or frame&quot; you
would like the accessed material to appear.
<P>
The API specification for one of the <EM>showDocument()</EM> 
methods on an AppletContext is as follows
<P><EM>
<PRE>
public void showDocument(URL url,
                         String target)

   Requests that the browser or applet viewer show the Web
   page indicated by the url argument. The target
   argument indicates in which HTML frame the document
   is to be displayed. The target argument is interpreted as
   follows: 

    ``_self&quot; 
             Show in the window and frame that
             contain the applet.
    ``_parent&quot;
             Show in the applet's parent frame. If the
             applet's frame has no parent frame, acts
             the same as ``_self&quot;.
    ``_top&quot; 
             Show in the top-level frame of the
             applet's window. If the applet's frame is
             the top-level frame, acts the same as
             ``_self&quot;.
    ``_blank&quot; 
             Show in a new, unnamed top-level
             window.
    name
             Show in the frame or window named
             name. If a target named name does not
             already exist, a new top-level window
             with the specified name is created, and the
             document is shown there.


   An applet viewer or browser is free to ignore
   showDocument.
   Parameters:
      url - an absolute URL giving the location of the
      document.
      target - a String indicating where to display the
      page.
</PRE>
</EM>
<P>
Thus, as you will see, you are allowed to specify the window
required by means of you supplying a specific string as the second
parameter. You will now hopefully appreciate
the complicated set of web pages and frames that
you have been asked to define.  Of the five choices available,
you are asked to implement the first four as I have
in my example. As an extra, you might like to add
names to your frames and implement the fifth option
later.
<P>
It's clearly ``unfriendly&quot; to ask a user to specify
his/her selection by typing the specific strings as documented
in the API for showDocument(). Thus, you are required
to provide easy to click options as I have done
in my example.  The area including the clickable items
is in my example defined as an object which extends a AWT panel.
I call my class that implements this, <EM>CheckPanel</EM>.
On that panel I use <EM>Checkbox</EM>s for the items that a user
may select and all are attached to CheckboxGroup so
that as I select one, the others become automatically
selected. My CheckPanel class has one available method,
and that returns a single String object referencing
the appropriate information as needed for the second
parameter to showDocument() when I invoke it.
<LI> The Load Request Button
<P>
Towards the right of my GUI I have a single button
labelled ``Load&quot;. You GUI should have such a similar
button too. On clicking the button, the Applet
should acquire the filename from the ``File Selection&quot;
are of your GUI and combine that with the ``documentbase&quot;
to form a URL. You will need to use the <EM>getDocumentBase()</EM>
method and the URL constructor to do this.
<P>
Having completed the above, the code obeying the Load
button should then acquire the indication of the required
window from the CheckPanel and then invoke the <EM>
showDocument()</EM> method to cause the request information to be displayed.
<LI> The Message Area
<P>
There should be a section on your display where the Applet
can output messages. On my example, the area is placed
at the bottom of the GUI and is implemented as
a <EM>TextArea</EM> inside a ScrollPane. You can implement
this anyway you choose.
<P></UL>
<LI> The Data Files
<P>
You will need to place all the classes for your Applet
and the web pages in an area of your web space. You will also
need to place within that area (or subdirectories of it)
some example text, html or images files that you can
allow the user to view via your application.
<P>
I've provided a few example gif (image) and au (audio)
files in the directory reached via the URL
<P>

<P>
you may copy these to your web area.
