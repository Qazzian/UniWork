<P>
<BIG>Michael A. Arbib</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Arbib has been working on brain theory, artificial intelligence
and related areas since the 1960s.
<LI> He distinguishes <EM>neural computing</EM> (or <EM>neural
engineering</EM> on the one hand from <EM>computational neuroscience</EM> on
the other, though regarding them as closely related.
<LI> Neural computing is the branch of artificial intelligence using
approaches inspired by human and other animal brains.
<LI> Computational neuroscience is the use of computer models to
advance understanding of how brains work.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>The Brain As A Machine</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Like artificial machines, the brain has a <EM>function</EM>:
enabling its possessor to adapt its behaviour to the environment in
order to achieve its goals.
<LI> Arbib stresses the structural and functional <EM>hierarchies</EM>
found in animal brains and behaviours.
<LI> He also stresses the close relation between <EM>perception</EM> and
<EM>action</EM>.
<LI> The brain is a <EM>network of neurons</EM>, coupled to <EM>receptors</EM>
and <EM>effectors</EM>, thus linking <EM>perception</EM> to <EM>action</EM>. 
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Structure And Function</BIG>
Both structure and function of the brain can be analysed at a number
of levels.

<P>
<P>
<BIG>Organisation Of The Brain</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Different <EM>regions</EM> of the brain deal with different
functions.
<LI> Within a region, different <EM>layers</EM> deal with different
levels of <EM>analysis</EM> of
sensory input, and of <EM>control</EM> of movement.
<LI> Positions of neurons within a layer <EM>usually</EM> have a
``maplike'' relationship to their function (e.g. the part of the body
surface or visual field they are concerned with).
<LI> ``The brain is a layered, somatotopic distributed computer.''
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Schematic View Of A Neuron</BIG>
<P>
There is no ``typical'' neuron! However, the figure shows features common to
most or all.
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

 SRC="img11.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig {figure=neurontiming.eps}
"></DIV>

<P>
<BIG>Properties of Neurons</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> At rest, there is a voltage difference (<EM>polarization</EM>)
across a neuron's surface membrane.
<LI> The neuron ``fires'' if its ``axon hillock''
<EM>depolarizes</EM> far enough, to a <EM>threshold</EM> level. At this
level, depolarization becomes self-sustaining.
<LI> A ``pulse'' then passes along the axon, to ``synaptic
endbulbs'', which  contact other neurons.
<LI> Depending on the type of synapse, it may either <EM>excite</EM> or
<EM>inhibit</EM> these neurons.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>The Importance Of Timing</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> A neuron may have excitatory and inhibitory inputs from many others.
<LI> It may also have an <EM>intrinsic</EM> firing rate even without
inputs.
<LI> The geometry of the cell, and the precise relative timing of inputs,
rather than just their average rates, may determine whether and when
the neuron fires.
<LI> This could (for example) allow a single cell to act as a motion detector.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Schemas</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Arbib views the behaviour of an organism, like its brain, as
hierarchically organized, but the two do not map directly
onto each other.
<LI> He calls the functional units <EM>schemas</EM> (compare Schank's
<EM>scripts</EM>, Minsky's <EM>frames</EM>). Schemas have <EM>
activation levels</EM>, and may compete and/or cooperate.
<LI> A <EM>perceptual schema</EM> is concerned with the recognition of
some state of the world relevant to the organism. A <EM>motor schema</EM>
controls a particular kind of action.
<LI> Given a schema-level model, we may look for neural
networks able to implement the individual schemas.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Example: The Computational Frog</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Arbib builds multilevel computational models of frogs'
brains and behaviour.
<LI> A frog snaps
at small objects (that might be insects, etc.), and jumps away if
something large looms over it. Here's a possible schema-level model of
this behaviour.
</UL>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig {figure=frogschemas1.eps}
"></DIV>

<P>
<BIG>Testing Schema-Level Models</BIG>
<P>
Such models can be tested experimentally:
<UL>
<LI> By varying the environment (what happens if a ``bug'' and an
``enemy'' appear at once?).
<LI> By ``lesion studies'' (giving the frog brain damage) -- if you
think you know which brain region deals with which schema.
</UL>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG WIDTH="525" HEIGHT="246" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig {figure=frogschemas2.eps}
"></DIV>

<P>
<BIG>Which Way To Jump</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> If the enemy is coming straight toward it, a frog will jump in a
direction somewhere between directly away from the enemy, and its
current heading.
<LI> But if the enemy is on course to pass in front
of the frog, it will jump away from where the enemy is heading.
</UL>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG WIDTH="526" HEIGHT="333" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img14.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig {figure=jump.eps}
"></DIV>

<P>
<BIG>Neural Network Models</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> This can be modelled using several sets of neurons,
three of which we mention here (the first two visual, the third motor).
<UL>
<LI> Each of the first (T3) set responds most strongly to a large
object centered on a particular point in visual field.
<LI> Each of the second (T2) set responds most strongly to such an
object <EM>moving from edge to centre of visual field</EM>.
<LI> Each of the third (MH) set makes the frog jump in a different direction.
</UL>
<LI> Excitation of an MH from a T3 can be countered by inhibition from the
corresponding T2, which will also excite a <EM>different</EM> MH. (Note:
Fig.5 in the photocopied paper is misleading.)
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>From Frogs To Robots</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Arbib has used his model of ``frog looming perception'' as the
basis of an approach to robot obstacle detection and detour path choice.
<LI> Main difference: there may be several obstacles at
once. ``Looming detector'' cells are connected to cells in the ``motor
map'' so that they <EM>inhibit</EM> those corresponding to the same
direction, and <EM>excite</EM> those some distance away.
<LI> Motor cells corresponding to directions nearer straight ahead
have a higher <EM>background activity</EM>, so they are more likely to be chosen.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Three Principles</BIG>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD><EM>Cooperative computation of schemas</EM>. Carried out by distributed
methods not involving explicit symbolic control: basis not only of
action, but of planning and language.
<DT>2.
<DD><EM>Evolution and modulation</EM>. New schemas often arise as
``modulators'' of existing ones, rather than as new systems. Examples:
adding T2 ``motion detectors'' to ``looming perception''; adding
barrier-detouring schemas to prey-capture schema; adding language to
action-based perception.
<DT>3.
<DD><EM>Interaction of partial representations</EM>. No one place in the
brain where a complete representation of the world links perception
and action.
</DL>

<P>
<BIG>From Instinctive To Reflective</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Frogs' schemas are mostly ``hardwired''. They <EM>react</EM>
adaptively, but don't plan ahead.
<LI> Evolutionary pressure for <EM>flexibility</EM> has led to <EM>goal
oriented, reflective</EM> behaviour and <EM>explicit</EM> representation of
goals.
<LI> Human ability to <EM>use</EM> symbolic representations is most
recent development in this direction.
<LI> <EM>Interaction</EM> of these two approaches vital to human
performance.
<LI> So why not to artificial intelligences?
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Schemas and Schema Instances</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> VISIONS computer vision system is based on use of schemas.
<LI> Schemas reside in LTM, schema <EM>instances</EM> in STM.
<LI> A schema instance is <EM>active</EM> in directing processing,
cooperates and competes with others, is associated with an area of the
image being interpreted.
<LI> Planning is distributed -- result of activity emerging in a
flexible network. (Compare with Hofstadter!)
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>From Biology to Technology</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> In computational neuroscience, we know that eventually,
behaviour must be accounted for in terms of the properties of neurons
and neural networks.
<LI> In software engineering, we can <EM>choose</EM>
our hardware.
