Lecture 4: Hofstadter's FARG</A>
</H1>

<BIG>CS36110, Part 1, Lecture 4:</BIG>
<P><BIG>Doug Hofstadter's</BIG>
<P><BIG>Fluid Analogies Research Group</BIG>
<P>
<P>
<BIG>Simon and Hofstadter</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Both interested in discovery of <EM>patterns</EM> (both have worked
on extending number-sequences).
<LI> Simon thinks we're ``nearly there'', Hofstadter thinks we've
``hardly started'', in progress toward genuine AI.
<LI> Simon thinks human cognition is rather simple, Hofstadter that
it's incredibly complex.
<LI> Simon thinks high-level problem-solving can be understood
without understanding how the brain works; Hofstadter doesn't.
<LI> Simon thinks human intelligence is largely serial; Hofstadter, that it
<EM>emerges</EM> out of multitudes of ``inaccessible'' parallel
processes.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Hofstadter's Central Concerns</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Overblown claims made for many AI programs.
<LI> Drift of AI away from fundamental issues.
<LI> Nature of creativity, insight, self-awareness.
<LI> Relation between perception and ``high-level'' thought.
<LI> Nature of <EM>concepts</EM>.
<LI> Importance of <EM>analogies</EM> and <EM>counterfactuals</EM>.
<LI> Usefulness of microworlds in AI research.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>My Summary of Hofstadter's Position</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Q. Why, after 50 years of AI research, are computers still so
<B>stupid</B>?
<LI> A. Because we still have very little understanding of what makes
people intelligent; and what we do have has largely been ignored by
most AI researchers.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>The ``ELIZA effect''</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> ELIZA: program written by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1964-6.
<LI> ``Conversed'' with users (via teletype), using sets of simple
``scripts'', the most impressive imitaing a Rogerian therapist.
<LI> Weizenbaum became alarmed at people's <EM>reaction</EM> to ELIZA
(see <EM>Computer Power and Human Reason</EM>, 1976).
<LI> Hofstadter claims that the ``ELIZA effect'' has systematically
obstructed objective assessment of AI programs by AI researchers.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Hofstadter's Own List of Themes</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Inseparability of perception and high-level cognition.
<LI> Easily reconfigurable, multi-level cognitive representations.
<LI> ``Subcognitive pressures''.
<LI> Commingling of many pressures.
<LI> Simultaneous feeling-out of many potential pathways.
<LI> Cognitive representations' <EM>deeper</EM> and <EM>shallower</EM> layers.
<LI> Crucial role of inner structure of concepts and conceptual
neighbourhoods.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Example Programs</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> <B>Seek-Whence</B>: Extrapolating number sequences.
<LI> <B>Jumbo</B>: modelling processes involved in finding anagrams.
<LI> <B>Copycat</B>: constructing analogies
(between transformations)
in a microworld of letter-sequences.
<LI> <B>Tabletop</B>: constructing analogies (between actions) in a
microworld of ``coffeehouse tabletops''.
<LI> <B>Letter Spirit</B>: designing typefaces. 
</UL>

<P><BIG>Copycat: Overview</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Written by Hofstadter and Melanie Mitchell (H/M).
<LI> ``Neither symbolic nor connectionist: ``subcognitive but superneural''.
<LI> Top-level behaviour <B>emerges</B> from parallel, stochastic
processing mechanism. <B>Concepts</B> implemented as distributed and
probabilistic entities in a network. (Contrast with GOFAI's ``atomic''
symbols.)
<LI> Intended to simulate ``the very crux of human cognition: fluid
concepts''.
<LI> Three main components: the ``Slipnet'' (roughly, long-term
memory), ``Workspace'' (roughly, short-term memory), and
``Coderack'' (no close counterpart in other architectures). 
</UL>

</UL>

<P><BIG>Copycat's Microdomain</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Set of <EM>basic object types</EM> (the letters <B>a-z</B>).
<LI> A basic relation between pairs of object types
(successor-predecessor, e.g. <B>{a,b}, {f,g}, {y,z}</B> -- but
not <B>{z,a}</B>).
<LI> A one dimensional ``space'' where <EM>structures</EM> (strings of
object <EM>tokens</EM> can exist, e.g. <B>abc, aabd, mrrjjj</B>. Copycat
can take account of the length of (short) strings.
<LI> The concepts of <EM>sameness</EM> and <EM>opposite</EM>
(e.g. successor/predecessor,
<BR>
leftmost/rightmost).
</UL>

<P><BIG>The Slipnet: 1</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Contains the permanent concepts (the 26 letters, also <EM>
letter, predecessor, successor, left, right, direction, group, group
length, 1, 2, 3, sameness, opposite</EM>...). Total of around 60.
<LI> ``Core'' of each concept represented by a <EM>node</EM>, each
conceptual relationship
by a <EM>link</EM>, with a length representing ``conceptual distance''.
<LI> Nodes acquire, spread and lose <EM>activation</EM> (relevance to
the current situation); links adjust their lengths.
<LI> Node and its ``halo'' of related nodes correspond to a concept.
</UL>

<P><BIG>The Slipnet: 2</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Each node has a <EM>conceptual depth</EM> -- generality,
abstractness, distance from direct perception. Once perceived,
``deeper'' concepts have more influence; activation decays more
slowly.
<LI> Links have ``labels'' which are themselves nodes (e.g. <EM>
opposite</EM>; activation of a label node shortens the links with that
label.
<LI> ``Slippability'' between concepts depends on existence of
discrete ``cores''
(which do not exist in distributed connectionist models).
</UL>

<P><BIG>The Workspace: 1</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Initially, unconnected pieces of raw data representing the
situation.
<LI> Multiple independent <EM>perceptual structures</EM> built (and
dismantled) in parallel by ``codelets'', until a coherent <EM>
viewpoint</EM> emerges.
<LI> Probability an object will receive attention depends on its <EM>
salience</EM> -- a function of its <EM>importance</EM> and <EM>
unhappiness</EM>.
<LI> Pairs of <EM>neighboring objects</EM> in the same string
scanned for relationships which can produce <EM>bonds</EM>. Sets of
bonded objects can form ``groups'' (higher-level objects).
</UL>

<P><BIG>The Workspace: 2</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Pairs of objects in <EM>different</EM> strings can be linked by
<EM>bridges</EM> or <EM>correspondences</EM>, gradually building up a
coherent mapping.
<LI> <EM>Identity mappings</EM> always help formation of a bridge;
<EM>conceptual slippages</EM> have to overcome resistance.
<LI> As Workspace evolves, pressure for a <EM>consistent viewpoint</EM>
increases.
<LI> Events in Workspace alter activations in Slipnet, which react on
Workspace...
<LI> General biases towards <EM>deep concepts</EM> and <EM>consistency</EM>
give Copycat a ``goal-oriented'' quality despite decentralization.
</UL>

<P><BIG>The Coderack</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> <EM>Codelets</EM> do all the scanning, bonding, bridging, grouping...
<LI> <EM>Scout codelets</EM> estimate promise of
actions: all they <EM>do</EM> is create further codelets. <EM>
Effector codelets</EM> attach descriptions to objects, or create/destroy
bonds/groups/bridges.
<LI> Created codelets placed in <EM>Coderack</EM>, assigned an
<EM>urgency</EM> determining <EM>probability</EM> of being selected to be
run and removed.
<LI> There are <EM>bottom-up</EM> codelets, continually being added; <EM>
top-down</EM> ones, placed by highly activated <EM>Slipnet</EM> nodes; <EM>
follow-up</EM> codelets placed by earlier codelets. 
</UL>

<P><BIG>Emergence of Fluidity</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> H/M compare Copycat's operations to what goes on inside
a cell: no centre of control, but interlocking feedback loops.
<LI> Copycat architecture allows many ``pressures'' to coexist, overlap,
compete and cooperate.
<LI> Use of <EM>scout codelets</EM> allows exploration of possibilities
in a <EM>parallel terraced scan</EM>.
<LI> Initial ``discoveries'' are local; scale of actions
gradually increases.
<LI> ``Temperature'' variable, reflecting how orderly
<EM>Workspace</EM> is, controls degree of randomness
used. Final temperature reflects solution quality.
</UL>

<P><BIG>Overall Trends During Run</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> <B>Slipnet:</B> Activation moves from ``shallower'' to
``deeper'' concepts, and increasingly clusters into <EM>themes</EM> of
closely-related, deep concepts.
<LI> <B>Workspace:</B> Shift from many local, unrelated objects toward
a few global, coherent structures.
<LI> <B>Coderack:</B> Initially, only bottom-up codelets
exist. Top-down codelets gradually come to dominate as a run proceeds.
<LI> Processing: shifts from parallel towards serial, bottom-up
towards top-down, nondeterministic towards deterministic.
</UL>

<P><BIG>Copycat's Answers to Problem 4</BIG>
<P>
1000 runs of <B>abc <IMG WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\rightarrow$"> abd, mrrjjj <IMG WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\rightarrow$"> ?</B>
<UL>
<LI> 705: <B>mrrkkk</B> Av. Temp: 43
<LI> 203: <B>mrrjjk</B> Av. Temp: 50
<LI> 45: <B>mrrjkk</B> Av. Temp: 46
<LI> 39: <B>mrrjjjj</B> Av. Temp: 20
<LI> 6: <B>mrrddd</B> Av. Temp: 46
<LI> 2: <B>mrrjjd</B> Av. Temp: 61
</UL>

<P><BIG>Robustness and Elegance</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Copycat has the potential to produce ``bad'' or ``weird''
answers, but avoids them most of the time -- H/M regard this
as a demonstration of its robustness.
<LI> The potential to produce ``bad'' answers appears essential if it
is to be able to produce impressive ``elegant'' ones (like <B>
mrrjjjj</B> in problem 4).
<LI> If temperature is ``clamped'' (forced to remain constant) it
seldom finds what Hofstadter considers the most ``elegant'' answers.
<LI> Testing on families of related problems can be seen as
``miniature Turing tests''.
</UL>

<P><BIG>Can Copycat ``Scale Up''?</BIG>
<P>
Remains to be proved, but H/M claim that none of the key ideas depend
on its small domain, and that the way in which concepts initially
disregarded can move first to the 
periphery, then to the centre of attention, allowing ``Dynamic
emergence of unpredictable objects and pathways'' to
occur, will permit domains of much greater size to be dealt with.
