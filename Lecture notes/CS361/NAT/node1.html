<BIG>Part 1: Main Questions</BIG>
<P><UL>
<LI> How do the achievements of AI research
compare with human intelligence?
<LI> How has study of natural problem-solving systems contributed to
AI research?
<LI> How has AI research contributed to the understanding of natural
problem-solving systems, and of intelligence in general.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>AI, Science And Engineering</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> ``Scientists explore what is. Engineers create what has never
been'' -- von Kalman.
<LI> The only uncontroversial
``intelligent agents'' are human beings. For <EM>some</EM> kinds of
problem, how they (or other
``natural problem solvers'') solve them may be the AI engineer's best guide.
<LI> When considering human information processing, what <EM>level</EM>
should we work at?
<LI> Other <EM>natural problem-solvers</EM>: non-human animals,
populations of organisms, ant colonies, immune systems,
organisations...
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>What Computers Can Do: 1</BIG>

<DT>1.
<DD>Play a very good game of chess.
<DT>2.
<DD>Write computer programs.
<DT>3.
<DD>Produce a complete timetable of exams for a university, taking
all constraints into account.
<DT>4.
<DD>Produce a good translation of a technical text; produce a
mediocre translation of non-technical texts; produce a useful summary

<DT>5.
<DD>Diagnose faults in mechanical equipment.
</DL>

<P>
<BIG>What Computers Can Do: 2</BIG>

</DL>

<P>
<BIG>Garry Kasparov And Deep Blue</BIG>
<P>
In 1997, world chess champion Kasparov, was defeated in a
6-game match by IBM's ``Deep Blue''. This event, and reactions to it,
provide a way into this part of the module.
<UL>
<LI> How does Deep Blue choose a move?
<LI> How does Garry Kasparov choose a move?
<LI> Is Deep Blue intelligent? Has it passed the Turing Test? Does it
really ``play chess''?
<LI> In 1957, Herbert Simon predicted that within ten years of that
date, a machine would be world chess champion. Why was he so wrong?
<LI> How useful are chess and other ``microworlds'' in AI research?
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>How Deep Blue Chooses A Move</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Special purpose hardware.
<LI> Minimaxing (14-15 ply, with refinements).
</UL>
<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG WIDTH="641" HEIGHT="238" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig {figure=minimax2.eps}
"></DIV>
<P>
<P>
<BIG>How Garry Kasparov Chooses A Move</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Practice for more than 30 years, building up a repertoire of
recognisable patterns.
<LI> Study the opponent in advance, seeking to understand their style
of play.
<LI> Plan and replan during the game, using your pattern repertoire.
<LI> Aim to disturb and disconcert the opponent.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>The Turing Test For Artificial Intelligence</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Proposed by mathematician and computer pioneer Alan Turing in 1950.
<LI> Usually described, inaccurately, as follows: a computer can be
regarded as intelligent if an &quot;interrogator&quot; is unable to tell, from
its typed responses to questions, that it is a machine rather than a
human.
<LI> As Turing actually posed it, slightly more complicated: can a
computer fool the interrogator into thinking it's a <EM>woman</EM>, as often as
a <EM>man</EM> can?
<P></UL>

<P>
<BIG>Deep Blue And The Turing Test</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Clearly, Deep Blue did not pass (or ``sit'') the Turing Test.
<LI> Nevertheless, it did <EM>appear</EM> to do something normally
<EM>thought</EM> to require intelligence. So:
<UL>
<LI> Does its ``BFI'' approach undermine its claim to intelligence?
<LI> Does the fact that it did not know it <EM>was</EM> playing chess?
<LI> Is playing (very good) chess sufficient evidence of intelligence?
</UL></UL>

<P><BIG>Formal, Expert and Mundane Tasks</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> <EM>Formal</EM> tasks include playing board or card games; solving
puzzles, and mathematical and logical problems; and programming. They
do <EM>not</EM> require knowledge of the real world. These have turned
out to be the <EM>easiest</EM> tasks for AI.
<LI> <EM>Expert</EM> tasks include medical diagnosis, engineering,
architectural or computer hardware design, and scheduling
(e.g. airline flights, school or university classes, manufacturing
processes).
<LI> <EM>Mundane</EM> tasks include things we might not think of as
tasks or problems at all: understanding everyday speech and written
language, making sense of what we see, and walking. These have turned
out to be the <EM>hardest</EM> tasks for AI.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>How To Pass The Turing Test</BIG>
<P>
What would an AI program need to do to pass the Turing test?
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Understand (typed) natural language.
<DT>2.
<DD>Produce (typed) natural language.
<DT>3.
<DD>Understand conversational structure.
<DT>4.
<DD>Display everyday knowledge.
<DT>5.
<DD>Display appropriate specialist knowledge.
<DT>6.
<DD>Model what its interrogator does and does not know.
<DT>7.
<DD>Model what <EM>it</EM> does and does not know.
</DL>

<P>
<BIG>Everyday Knowledge</BIG>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Knowledge of time, space, and the physical world.
<DT>2.
<DD>Knowledge of the social and personal worlds.
<DT>3.
<DD>Knowledge of specific people, places, events...
<DT>4.
<DD>Knowledge of the <EM>appearances</EM> of things.
<DT>5.
<DD>Knowledge of your own past: ``episodic memory''.
<DT>6.
<DD>Knowledge about your own knowledge: ``metaknowledge''.
<DT>7.
<DD>Knowledge about what most people do and don't know.
</DL>

<P>
<BIG>More Rash Predictions</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> ``... within twenty years machines will be
capable of doing any work a man can do.'' -- Herbert Simon, 1965.
<LI> ``I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible
to programme computers... to play the imitation game so well that an
average interrogator will not have more than 70% chance of making the
right identification after five minutes of questioning.'' -- Alan
Turing, 1950.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Why Will Turing Be Wrong?</BIG>
<P>
Here are several possible answers:
<UL>
<LI> Hardware limitations.
<LI> More <EM>knowledge</EM> needed than he realised.
<LI> Better machine learning techniques needed.
<LI> Intelligence must be based on sensory-motor
interaction with the world.
<LI> Intelligence requires social interaction.
<LI> Intelligence requires something which is present in human
brains, but not in silicon chips.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Microworlds and World Knowledge</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> ``Microworlds'': self-contained, limited range of
possible actions, and requirements for knowledge.
<LI> Much early AI work on them, using general
techniques of search and matching.
<LI> Problems with ``scaling up'' to more realistic domains.
<LI> General conclusion: need for <EM>
domain-specific knowledge</EM>. Microworlds are useless.
<LI> Minority opinion (Hofstadter). Knowledge is not
enough. We have scarcely begun to understand intelligence.
Microworlds a vital research tool.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Lecture 1: Main Points</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> AI has made substantial progress, but far less than most of the
``pioneers'' expected.
<LI> Tasks <EM>thought</EM> to be at the pinnacle of intelligence
(e.g. chess) turn out to be (relatively!) easy, compared to
``mundane'' tasks (holding a conversation, seeing, sweeping
floors). <EM>General, flexible</EM> artificial intelligence still far off.
<LI> The best route towards such full-scale AI (and even whether it
is possible) remain open questions.
</UL>
