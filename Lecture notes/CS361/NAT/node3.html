<BIG>CS36110, Part 1, Lecture 3:</BIG>
<P><BIG>Scientific Discovery --</BIG>
<P><BIG>BACON and other Programs</BIG>

<P>
<BIG>Simon's Claims</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Scientific discovery can be explained in terms of <EM>
general</EM> features of human thinking or problem-solving, which Simon
considers are quite well understood.
<LI> ``Computer programs exist today that, given the
same initial conditions that confronted certain human scientists,
remake the discoveries the scientists made.''
<LI> At least one program (DENDRAL) has made original scientific
discoveries. There is no reason why others should not do the same.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Simon On Scientific Discovery</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Simon believes working scientists spend more time on <EM>scientific
discovery</EM> (looking
for regularities in data and trying to find <EM>some</EM> theory
explaining them), than in testing or comparing theories.
<LI> He sees scientific discovery as fundamentally the same as other
forms of problem-solving, involving no ``special mechanisms'' of
insight or inspiration.
<LI> His approach to understanding the process of scientific research involves
breaking it down into subprocesses, making AI models of the parts,
then integrating these models.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Simon's On Problem Solving</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Most problem solving involves selective search through large
spaces of possibilities.
<LI> Both domain-specific and general heuristics are used: human
beings fall back on general heuristics
(``weak methods'') when domain-specific ones are
unavailable or fail.
<LI> The most important heuristic is <EM>means-end
analysis</EM>. Effectiveness depends on ability to <EM>recognise</EM>
features of
current state, and recall relevant operators for
reducing the difference between it and the goal state.
<LI> The domain-specific (recognition and recall) knowledge
distinguishing experts from novices is stored in the form of <EM>
productions</EM> (condition-action rules).
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Search Spaces</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> A <EM>search space</EM> includes:
<UL>
<LI> A set of <EM>nodes</EM> or <EM>states</EM>, including an <EM>initial
node</EM>, and one or more <EM>goal nodes</EM>.
<LI> A set of <EM>operators</EM>, used in order to move from the current node
to a neighbouring one.
</UL>
<LI> The <EM>search</EM> may be:
<UL>
<LI> <EM>Exhaustive</EM>: all nodes are examined, using procedures like
<EM>depth-first</EM> or <EM>breadth-first</EM> search.
<LI> <EM>Heuristic</EM>: guided by some way of estimating which node
should be ``expanded'' next, and/or which operator should be used.
</UL></UL>

<P>
<BIG>How Productions Guide Search</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> A production <EM>fires</EM> when its <EM>condition</EM> is matched by
contents of short-term memory and/or features of current environment.
<LI> Its <EM>action</EM> is then to alter the contents of short-term
memory.
<LI> An important way of doing this is to <EM>recall</EM> information
from long-term memory.
<LI> This information can then be used in <EM>guiding</EM> a search process.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Well-Structured Problems</BIG>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Effective test of proposed solutions.
<DT>2.
<DD>At least one problem-space where all ``considerable'' states can
be represented. 
<DT>3.
<DD>At least one problem-space where all ``considerable''<EM>moves</EM>
can be represented.
<DT>4.
<DD>Any relevant knowledge that can be acquired can be represented
in terms of one or more problem-spaces.
<DT>5.
<DD>If action on the external world is involved, effects of actions
are accurately known.
<DT>6.
<DD>Only ``reasonable''
amounts of computation are required.
</DL>

<P>
<BIG>Alternatives To Simple Search</BIG>
<P>
Applicability of search to ``ill-structured'' real-world problems
can be challenged. Simon suggests various extensions/modifications including:
<UL>
<LI> Planning: try to find some <EM>intermediate</EM> nodes on the way
from the initial node to a goal node.
<LI> Create a less abstract version of the problem and use that
to guide search (e.g., using a diagram to guide a search for a
geometric proof).
<LI> Put information gathered at one node onto a ``blackboard'' so it
can be used elsewhere. Taking this as far as possible produces a <EM>
constraint-based</EM> approach, where nodes are states of <EM>
knowledge</EM> rather than of the world. 
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Well-Structured/Ill-Structured</BIG>
<P>
Simon also argues that the distinction between well-structured and
ill-structured problems is one of degree, not qualitative.
<UL>
<LI> Apparently well-structured problems (e.g. chess), do not meet
the conditions given: we <EM>can't</EM>
normally be sure a proposed move wins (too much computation), and we
<EM>can't</EM> be sure what the consequences of a move will be (what the
opponent will do). The space to be searched is different every move.
<LI> Conversely, a problem like designing a house or ship looks
ill-structured, but is <EM>decomposed</EM> into a series of more-or-less
well-structured problems.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>BACON</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> BACON is given data involving one or more ``independent
variables'' and one ``dependent variable'' (e.g. temperature, quantity
of gas, pressure as i.v.s, volume as d.v.).
<LI> ``Searches'' in 2 ``spaces'': space of data and space of laws:
``the system's search for laws is <EM>embedded</EM> within its 
search for data.''.
<LI> The ``search'' in the ``space of data'', however, is trivial:
the values the i.v.s can take are given by the user, and all
nodes are visited in a fixed order.
<LI> User provides ``information about the <EM>form</EM> that plausible
laws may take.''
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>BACON: Searching For Laws</BIG>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Keeping all i.v.s but one fixed, BACON searches for a ``set of
parameters'' relating values of the the last i.v. to those of the
d.v.. ``Best'' set is the one that ``maximally predicts'' the
observed data. 
<DT>2.
<DD>Search results in a ``law'', stored for future use if there
ismore than 1 i.v.
<DT>3.
<DD>Steps (1) and (2) repeated for each possible value of another
i.v. The first-level ``laws'' are then used to search for
a second-level law, relating <EM>two</EM> i.v.s to the d.v.
<DT>4.
<DD>This process is continued through as many levels as there are
i.v.s.
<DT>5.
<DD>BACON can also handle non-numerical i.v.s (e.g. different substances).
</DL>

<P>
<BIG>GLAUBER</BIG>
<P>
Aimed at discovering <EM>qualitative</EM> rather than <EM>
quantitative</EM> relations: simulating discovery of <EM>classes</EM> of chemical
substances such as acids, alkalis and salts. Viewed as a search program:
<UL>
<LI> Initial state: ``facts'' about particular chemicals. Goal state:
definitions of ``classes'' of these chemicals, with ``laws'' relating them.
<LI> Operators: <B>Form-law</B> -- defines a class and substitutes it
into ``facts''; <B>Determine-quantifier</B> -- specifies whether the
law applies to all members of the class(es) concerned, or just to
some.
<LI> ``Best-first'' search with no backtracking. <B>Form-law</B>
selects object occurring in the most ``analogous facts''; user
determines how ``cautious'' <B>Determine-quantifier</B> is.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>STAHL</BIG>
<P>
Aimed at determining the components of substances. Viewed as a search program:
<UL>
<LI> Initial state: list of reactions relating substances. Goal
state: components of each compound substance.
<LI> Example operators+heuristics:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Infer-composition</B>. If A and B react to form C, or if C
decomposes into A and B, then infer that C is composed of A and B.
<LI> <B>Identify-compounds</B>. If A is composed of C and D, and B is
composed of C and D, then identify A with B.
</UL>
<LI> Depth-first search without backtracking.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>DALTON</BIG>
<P>``Follows on'' from STAHL (accpets as input the type of information
output by STAHL). Viewed as a search program:
<UL>
<LI> Initial state: list of reactions, and components of substances
involved. Goal state: Model of each reaction, specifying 
number of molecules of each substance, number of ``particles'' (atoms)
in each type of molecule.
<LI> Operators: <B>Determine-molecules</B> hypothesizes number of
molecules of a particular type involved. <B>Determine-atoms</B>
hypothesizes number of atoms of a particular type in a particular
molecule. <B>Conserve-particles</B> ensures number of atoms of each
type is unchanged by the reaction.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Towards An Integrated</BIG>
<BIG>Discovery System?</BIG>
<P>``To the extent that it can be achieved, an integrated discovery
system would be much less susceptible to the criticism that one is
`building in discoveries' by providing the necessary inputs.''

<P>
<BIG>Hofstadter's Critique</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Hofstadter takes BACON as exemplifying
serious flaws in most GOFAI research, which bypasses problems
such as the integration of perception and cognition, and the ability to
shift flexibly between representations of a situation.
<LI> Claims BACON and Simon's other programs are fed data they
need ``predigested'', unlike scientists being ``simulated''.
<LI> Qin and Simon found university students, starting with the same
data as BACON, often made the same ``discoveries''  within an
hour. This shows BACON has little 
relation to real scientific discovery!
<LI> Easy to be fooled into thinking an AI program
understands more than it does.
</UL>

<P><BIG>Comparison: DENDRAL</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Developed by E. Feigenbaum and others from 1965, first publication 1971.
<LI> Domain: enumerating structures of organic molecules, given data
from spectrometers, plus user-supplied constraints.
<LI> Switch to (situation-action) rule-based approach 1967. Rule has
to capture a meaningful chunk of knowledge.
<LI> Better than human experts within certain narrow classes of molecules,
but much less flexible. 
Regularly used by Stanford University chemists.
</UL>

<P><BIG>DENDRAL's Approach</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Generate all topologically
possible
structures (using a subprogram called CONGEN)...
<LI> <EM>within</EM> constraints set by the user or a built-in planning
process which favours the most plausible structures.
<LI> Then test the proposed structures
by predicting the instrument data.
</UL>

<P><BIG>META-DENDRAL</BIG>
<P>
META-DENDRAL inferred rules of mass spectrometry, for possible use by
DENDRAL.
<UL>
<LI> Input: spectrometer data from known molecules.
<LI> Output: set of fragmentation rules discovered, plus summary of
evidence for and against each rule.
<LI> Produced rule-sets of comparable quality to those produced by
consultation with experts.
