<BIG>Overview of Lecture</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Intelligence is Social
<LI> Real Ants
<LI> Travelling SalesAnts
<LI> Ants On The Line
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Intelligence is Social</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Almost all the most intelligent non-human animals are highly
social (most primates, dogs, dolphins, parrots...).
<LI> Individual humans are no cleverer than 30,000 years ago; yet our
<EM>collective</EM> abilities have expanded enormously.
<LI> Social insects (bees, wasps, ants, termites) fight off
predators, build complex
structures, ``domesticate'' or ``enslave'' fungi and other insects...
<LI> How do human and other animal societies <EM>work</EM>?
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Real Ants</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Ant colonies are founded by a single queen, but may grow to
contain millions of individuals.
<LI> Some are migratory (e.g. army ants). Most build complex nests.
<LI> Individual ants cooperate to repel invaders, collect or grow food, rear
the young.
<LI> A biological puzzle: why are ants, bees, wasps, termites <EM>
and no other insects</EM> social?
<LI> Communication between ants is primarily <EM>chemical</EM>.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Pheromones</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Pheromones: chemicals used in animal communication.
<LI> Ants leave a chemical <EM>trail</EM> behind them when
they forage for food.
<LI> They also have a <EM>tendency</EM> to follow the trails laid by their
nestmates. Trails therefore tend to grow stronger by an <EM>
autocatalytic</EM> or positive feedback effect.
<LI> These simple features enable
them to use the world as a collective memory bank: this is <EM>stigmergy</EM>.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Stigmergy</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Concept introduced by Grasse in 1959, primarily to explain <EM>
nest-building</EM> by social insects.
<LI> Individual insects modify the environment (add a bit to the nest,
lay a trail).
<LI> These modifications provide new stimuli to all insects that
encounter them.
<LI> These stimuli affect their behavioural responses, which in turn
modify the environment further.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Finding Food Sources</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Ants spread out from their nest,
looking for food. Ants finding food return with it.
<LI> Depending on species, may lay pheromone going out, coming back,
or both.
<LI> In some species, richness of food source found influences amount
of pheromone laid.
<LI> Decision to follow a trail influenced by amount of pheromone,
but <EM>probabilistic</EM>.
<LI> Also, always a few ants wandering off apparently at random.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Finding Shortest Routes</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> If a source is found by two routes, the shorter will gain an advantage.
<LI> The system isn't perfect: new shortcuts difficult to find,
circular routes can occur.
</UL>

<BIG>Ant System</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> <EM><B>Ant System</B></EM>, devised by Alberto Colorni and others
for <EM>distributed optimization</EM>.
<LI> Based on <EM>simple</EM> cooperating agents with <EM>limited</EM>
communicative abilities: distinguishes ``ant-based''
from other <EM>multi-agent</EM> systems.
<LI> The ``ants'' in Ant System have no idea they are cooperating
with other ants, or even that there are other ants.
<LI> However, they have some features not needed for stigmergy to
work: some memory, some ability to
sense things other than trail pheromone.
<LI> Time in the ants ``world'' is discrete.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Travelling SalesAnts: 1</BIG>
<P><EM><B>Ant System</B></EM> has been applied to the Travelling
Salesman Problem. Initially (at <I>t</I>=0):
<UL>
<LI> Ants are distributed evenly among all the ``cities''
to be toured.
<LI> Low levels of trail pheromone are assigned at random to the
``trail'' between each pair of cities.
<LI> One of three different ``ant algorithms'' is selected, and various
numerical parameters are set by the user.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Travelling SalesAnts: 2</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> At each time-step, each ant chooses a city to move to. This will add to
the strength of the trail between the two.
<LI> Each ant keeps a list of cities visited, and will not visit
again until it has made a complete ``tour'' of the cities, when its list is
cleared.
<LI> The problem-solving process continues for some preset
number of complete tours.
<LI> A user defineable proportion of pheromone ``evaporates'' every
time-step. The proportion <EM>remaining</EM> is symbolised <IMG WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="61" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img19.gif"
 ALT="$\rho$">.</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Travelling SalesAnts: 3</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> An ant decides which unvisited city to go to next
probabilistically, taking into account both their distance from its
current location (or rather, its reciprocal, ``visibility'',
symbolised <IMG WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="61" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.gif"
 ALT="$\eta$">), and the strength
of the trails to them.
<LI> Specifically, the <EM>transition probability</EM> from town <I>i</I> to
town <I>j</I> at time <I>t</I> is given by the formula:
<BR>
 <IMG WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="77" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img21.gif"
 ALT="$p_{ij}(t) =
\frac{[\tau_{ij}(t)]^{\alpha}\times[\eta_{ij}(t)]^{\beta}}{\sum_{j=1}^n[\tau_{ij}(t)]^{\alpha}\times[\eta_{ij}(t)]^{\beta}}$">
<BR>
(where <IMG WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="63" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img22.gif"
 ALT="$\alpha, \beta$"> are parameters set by the user).
<LI> Different choices in calculating how much pheromone to add to
the trails followed define the different ``ant algorithms''.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Ant Algorithms</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> <B>ANT-quantity</B> algorithm: fixed amount <I>Q<SUB>1</SUB></I> of
pheromone is left on a trail that is followed -- so the <EM>
concentration</EM> of pheromone added is greater for closer pairs of cities.
<LI> <B>ANT-density</B> algorithm: fixed amount <I>Q<SUB>2</SUB></I> of
pheromone is left on every unit of length of a trail that is followed
-- so closer pairs of cities are not given the same advantage as in
<B>ANT-quantity</B>.
<LI> <B>ANT-cycle</B> algorithm: pheromone densities
not updated after every time-step, but after ants have
completed a tour. Fixed amount <I>Q<SUB>3</SUB></I> of
pheromone is spread evenly over complete path of each ant -- so
shorter tours contribute greater density of pheromone.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Results</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> For all three algorithms, performance depended strongly on the
values of the parameters (<IMG WIDTH="70" HEIGHT="63" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img23.gif"
 ALT="$\alpha, \beta, \rho$"> and <I>Q<SUB>1</SUB></I>,<I>Q<SUB>2</SUB></I> or <I>Q<SUB>3</SUB></I>
depending on the algorithm).
<LI> Optimal parameters could only be discovered experimentally.
<LI> <B>ANT-cycle</B> proved significantly more successful than the
other two.
<LI> Using more ants (up to 64) decreased total computation for <B>
ANT-quantity</B> and <B>ANT-density</B>, while
16 ants gave better results than more or fewer for <B>ANT-cycle</B>.
<LI> <B><EM>Ant-system</EM></B> found better results than other approaches
tried, but took longer.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Ants On The Line</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Ruud Schoonderwoerd and others are investigating ant-based
control (``ABC'') of load balancing in telecommunications networks, for
Hewlett-Packard.
<LI> Problem: nodes with excess traffic get congested, causing calls
to be lost.
<LI> Communications networks are not built to guarantee successful
connections on every call.
<LI> Number of failures is reduced by routing calls through parts of
network with spare capacity: ``load balancing''.
<LI> Central control of such systems requires links to every part of
system, and scales badly.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Network Simulation: 1</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Simulated network used to test ABC against use of fixed routes
and use of more complex ``load balancing agents'', investigated by BT.
<LI> Each node (switching stations) has:
<UL>
<LI> Capacity: number of simultaneous calls allowed.
<LI> Routing table, with entry for each of the other nodes.
<LI> Probability of being end node of a call.
<LI> Current spare capacity.
</UL></UL>

<P>
<BIG>Network Simulation: 2</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> <EM>Ants</EM> generated at nodes, with random destinations.
At each node, there is a ``pheromone table'' for <EM>each</EM> destination.
<LI> Ants move one node per time step, choosing next node <EM>
probabilistically</EM> on basis of destination's pheromone table.
<LI> Alter pheromone table <EM>for their source node</EM> at each node
they reach.
<LI> <EM>Calls</EM> have a source, destination, duration.
At each time step, expired calls are removed. New calls routed
<EM>deterministically</EM> using pheromone tables.
<LI> If any node on route is full, call is lost: % lost calls
measures performance.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>How Ants find Routes</BIG>
<P>
Aim: to get ants to find short routes, but avoid congestion.
<UL>
<LI> Ants lay less pheromone the longer they have been travelling.
<LI> So those finding short routes to destination tend to have most effect.
<LI> Ants are delayed at nodes congested with calls -- so at
subsequent nodes, they are older and lay less pheromone.
<LI> Hence, ants and calls dynamically interact with each other.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Ants Versus Load Agents: 1</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Schoonderwoerd compared ants with use of fixed shortest-path
routes, and with use of an alternative type of mobile agent.
<LI> Alternative ``load agents'' rewrite routing tables for nodes identified
as needing traffic management by ``parent agents'' using global data
on network traffic.
<LI> Both ants and load agents able to adapt to network topology,
static pattern of call probabilities, and changes in these probabilities.
<LI> Ants outperformed load agents which outperformed fixed routes.
</UL>

<P>
<BIG>Ants Versus Load Agents: 2</BIG>
<UL>
<LI> Ants used less bandwidth and switching capacity.
<LI> ABC system probably more
robust: ants do not interfere with each other, and ``damage caused by
a corrupt ant will be limited''.
<LI> Ants likely to need more computation at nodes.
<LI> Load agents respond faster to changing call probabilities. This
only <EM>reduces</EM> (does not <EM>eliminate</EM>) ants' performance advantage.
</UL>
