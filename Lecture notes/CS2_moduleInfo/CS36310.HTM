<H2>Brief Description</H2>This module concentrates on the technology and 
methodology of Artificial Intelligence practice, in particular, programming 
languages and software systems. The aim is to build on the concepts introduced 
in <A 
href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/~dcswww/Dept/Teaching/Syllabus/1999-00/CS26210.module.html">CS26210</A> 
and show how knowledge-based systems can be implemented, developed and 
evaluated.

<H2>Aims</H2></A>
<P>This course will provide a good understanding of a variety of AI systems from 
machine learning to expert systems. This will enable students to gain an 
understanding of the current state of the art in applied AI systems. <A

<H2>Objectives</H2></A>On successful completion of this module students should: 
<UL>
  <LI>understand the differences between the main classes of application 
  oriented intelligent system, including representation and reasoning 
  facilitites, and performance issues; 
  <LI>understand the issues involved in constructing effective diagnostic 
  systems 
  <LI>appreciate the problem of software engineering for intelligent systems;

<DL>
  <DT>Effective Diagnostic Expert Systems - <EM>3 Lectures</EM>
  <DD>Building on CS36210, these lectures will introduce how to build effective 
  diagnostic systems for man made systems. It will therefore look at diagnostic 
  trees, diagnostic test benches and issues associated with diagnostic 
  systems.From these lectures the student should gain an understanding of the 
  features of commercial expert systems tools and their strengths and 
  limitations. 
  <DT>Case based reasoning - <EM>2 Lectures</EM>
  <DD>These lectures will provide the student with an understanding of the 
  techniques which comprise a case-based reasoning (CBR) system. They should 
  also gain an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses for diagnostic 
  applications as well as when to apply and when not to apply CBR. The lectures 
  will consider the basic structure of a CBR system and the use of a case base, 
  representation and indexing of cases, case retrieval and adaptation and 
  finally case repair. 
  <DT>Model-based Reasoning - <EM>3 Lectures</EM>
  <DD>In these lectures "Functional" model based reasoning will be introduced. 
  How a functional model-based system can be constructed and the problems and 
  issues associated with such a task will be considered. In addition a 
  functional model-based system constructed for Engineers will be considered in 
  detail. This case study will highlight the trade offs which had to be made 
  between ease of use and flexibility, power, etc. 
  <DT>MBR for Failure Mode Effect Analysis - <EM>2 Lectures</EM>
  <DD>These lectures will look at how MBR can be used as the basis of a design 
  analysis system which can be used to provide information necessary for the 
  construction of diagnostic systems. 
  <DT>Neural Networks - <EM>3 Lectures</EM>
  <DD>These lectures will introduce the concepts behind Neural Networks and 
  investigate some of the more important and useful neural network 
  architectures. They will also aim to give an appreciation of the application 
  of neural computing in industry. 
  <DT>Machine Induction - <EM>3 Lectures</EM>
  <DD>There are a large number of applications which exploit the approach to 
  machine learning known as induction. In these lectures we will consider the 
  application pf these methods. 
  <DT>Inductive Logic Programming - <EM>2 Lectures</EM>
  <DD>Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a new and exciting development in AI 
  systems which has a wide range of applications. These lectures will introduce 
  ILP and the issues associated with applying ILP to real world problems. 
  <DT>Data Mining - <EM>2 Lectures</EM>, <EM>1 Practical</EM>
  <DD>Data mining has become one of the fastest growing application areas in AI. 
  It combines various AI techniques such as neural networks and machine 
  induction with statistical analysis and database techniques. A commercial Data 
  Mining tool "Clementine" will be considered during these lectures. </DD></DL><A
