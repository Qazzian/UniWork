<H2>Brief Description</H2>On successful completion of this module, students will 
be familiar with the ideas used in database packages for personal computers and 
be able to design and construct a database using such a package to store and 
retrieve information of the type they will encounter in their studies.

<H2>Aims</H2></A>
<P>This module provides an introduction to the use of a relational database 
management system so that: 
<UL>
  <LI>students will be able to design, construct and use simple databases from 
  (appropriate) material they encounter elsewhere in their studies; 
  <LI>students will gain an appreciation of the ideas that lie behind the 
  <EM>relational </EM>database paradigm </LI></UL>
<P>The philosophy of the course will be to provide students with a tool and with 
techniques that they can use elsewhere in their studies. The practicals will be 
based on the microcomputer package <EM>Microsoft Access. </EM><A 
name=objectivesanchor>
<H2>Objectives</H2></A>
<P>On successful completion of this module, students should be able to: 
<UL>
  <LI>set up and interrogate a single-table database, and produce well-designed 
  forms and reports from it; 
  <LI>explain the reasons for using a multi-table database; 
  <LI>recognise the problems leading to modification anomalies and be able to 
  address simple examples of them using the relational model and normalisation; 
  <LI>design, construct and use a <EM>simple </EM>multi-table database.
