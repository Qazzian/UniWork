<P>A small supermarket has four checkouts. Each checkout has:</P>

<UL>
<LI>a bar code reader to identify the items purchased,</LI>

<LI>a till on which the items and prices are displayed, and which has only
a 'TOTAL' button that is pressed when a customer's items have all been processed,</LI>

<LI>a printer on which an itemised bill is printed when the 'TOTAL' button
has been pressed,</LI>

<LI>a communications link to a central computer system that holds the price
information for each item in the supermarket and which is interrogated
for each item processed by a checkout.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The central computer system has a terminal that permits the manager
to view the data, to revise prices, and to add and delete items.</P>

<P>Draw a complete set of MASCOT 3 diagrams for this system. Label your
diagrams so as to indicate clearly the purpose of each component. Do not
add any further explanation of your design.</P>
