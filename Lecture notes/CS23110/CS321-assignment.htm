<BR>A small supermarket has four checkouts.&nbsp; Each checkout has a bar-code 
reader and a till.&nbsp; There is a central database&nbsp; that holds the bar 
code numbers, prices and descriptions of all the products in the 
supermarket.&nbsp; The manager has a terminal that allows the database to be 
updated.&nbsp; As each item is scanned by the checkout operator, a list of that 
customer&#8217;s purchases, with prices, is created.&nbsp; When the customer&#8217;s last 
item has been scanned, the operator presses a &#8216;total&#8217; button on the till and the 
bill is printed out by the till.&nbsp; Draw a complete set of MASCOT diagrams 
for this system and label each component in such a way as to indicate clearly 
its purpose.&nbsp; Do not give any other explanation of your design.&nbsp; Avoid 
the use of SIDAs, using only channels or pools to represent shared data 
structures. <BR>
