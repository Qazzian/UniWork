<br>A small supermarket has four checkouts.&nbsp; Each checkout has a bar-code
reader and a till.&nbsp; There is a central database&nbsp; that holds the
bar code numbers, prices and descriptions of all the products in the supermarket.&nbsp;
The manager has a terminal that allows the database to be updated.&nbsp;
As each item is scanned by the checkout operator, a list of that customer’s
purchases, with prices, is created.&nbsp; When the customer’s last item
has been scanned, the operator presses a ‘total’ button on the till and
the bill is printed out by the till.&nbsp; Draw a complete set of MASCOT
diagrams for this system and label each component in such a way as to indicate
clearly its purpose.&nbsp; Do not give any other explanation of your design.&nbsp;
Avoid the use of SIDAs, using only channels or pools to represent shared
data structures.
