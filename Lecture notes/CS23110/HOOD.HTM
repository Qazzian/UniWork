<P><B>A very brief look at other design methods:</B></P>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>HOOD: </B>`Hierarchical Object Oriented Design'. </FONT></P>

<P>HOOD is in some ways an alternative to MASCOT but is 'object-based'.</P>

<P>It has its origins in France, for the European Space Agency. It is/was
used in the EFA (Eurofighter) project.</P>

<P>Had a mixed reception in the software engineering community.</P>

<P>The system is decomposed into objects.

<P>Objects are normally related to system functions - i.e. functional decomposition
is used. </P>

<P>Parent objects decompose into child objects. </P>

<P>There are active objects and passive objects. The active objects contain
a concurrent thread of execution. Passive objects do not - they provide
a service via ADTs and their associated operations.</P>

<P>Objects call other objects. Active objects can call active or passive
objects; passive objects can only call other passive objects.</P>

<P>HOOD is hierarchical and two hierarchies are represented in the diagrams:</P>

<UL>
<LI>the 'uses' hierarchy</LI>

<LI>the functional decomposition.</LI>
</UL>

<P>HOOD is diagrammatic, but does not explicitly represent concurrency
in the way that MASCOT&nbsp;does; indications of concurrency are via
the existence of the active objects.</P>

<P>There is also a textual representation. </P>

<P>Concurrent objects can communicate directly, not via (explicit) shared
data areas, but HOOD is used with Ada and IPC uses the Ada rendezvous.
</P>

<P>Unlike MASCOT, HOOD diagrams represent execution control information
such as interrupts, timeouts, (Ada) exceptions. </P>

<P>The diagrammatic representation in HOOD is useful for representing <I>the
outcome of a design process; </I>it is not that good for progressively
developing a design.</P>

<P>MASCOT provides a better visualisation of what goes on inside a concurrent
system.</P>

<P>A more recent development of HOOD is HRT HOOD.</P>

<P>This improves its use as a progressive design tool.</P>

<P>Useful overviews of HOOD&nbsp;are provided in the books by Budgen and Cooling
 (see
the <A HREF="books.htm">book list</A>). 
A worked example in HRT HOOD is given in the book by Burns and Wellings (Editions 2 and 3).</P>

<P><BR>
<B>UML and Real Time Systems.</B></P>

<P>UML is rapidly becoming the dominant notation for OO analysis and design.</P>

<P> ..... but there is still much work to be 
done before there is a standard for its use  
in relation to Real Time Systems.</P>
