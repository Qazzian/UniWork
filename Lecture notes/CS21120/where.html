<h1> Program Design, Data Structures and Algorithms - progress</h1>
A report on what we are doing and when:
<ul>
<li>Monday October 16th: 
<ul> 
<li> we started Linked Lists. Will finish them on Friday.
<li> I have handed out the first assignment - worth 30% of your mark. Due Nov 24th.
</ul>
<li> Thursday October 19th - changes in pracs!!!
<ul>
<li>you should be working on your unix prac 1 (weeks
        ending Oct 13th and Oct 20th). Must be signed off by Oct 27th.
 <li>   Then do unix prac2. Should be signed off by Nov 9th.
 <li> Then the first data struct prac,
 prac1 which is about queues in next 1-2 weeks. Should be signed off by Nov 16th.

    <li> Next is prac2 which should be signed off by Nov 30th. Remember you also always have your assignment!

    </ul>
    <li> 19/11/00: You did some stuff with Andy Starr and then me about complexity. 
We are currently doing recursion and will soon start trees. 
The last practical of the term that needs signing off is on recursion (by the end of term). 
That gives you a free week. You might want to play with trees - but I'll start next term with 
a prac on that.
    </ul>
