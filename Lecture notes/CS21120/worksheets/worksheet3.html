<OL>

</B></I></FONT><LI>Start an xterm on <FONT FACE="Arial">stonkin</FONT>.  Set the <FONT FACE="Arial">DISPLAY</FONT> to the machine you are using.  From the xterm, start Rational Rose with the command <FONT FACE="Arial">rose</FONT><I>.  </I>Ignore the initial set of warning messages that you get the first time that you run Rose.  These should not appear on subsequent runs.  You should not need to change your path environment variable to access Rose.</LI>
<LI>When the Rational Rose main window has appeared, select &quot;Rational Rose Help Topics&quot; from the &quot;Help&quot; menu.  Open the &quot;Rational Rose&quot; topic, the open &quot;Concepts&quot;, and then display &quot;Analysis and Design&quot;.</LI>
<LI>Work through the help pages and, at the same time, experiment with the diagramming facilities of the tool.  In particular, try to construct a very simple use case diagram.</LI></OL>

</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Note</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>There appears to be a bug in the SPARC version of Rational Rose that has prevented some students saving their work to file.  We are investigating this with Rational.  For the moment, save your work to files in /tmp.  Use filenames containing your userid to avoid name conflicts with other students.  At the end of your Rational Rose session, move the files from /tmp into your own filestore.  (N.B.  If you don’t do this, your files may be lost.)  Before starting another Rational Rose session, move your files back from your own filestore to /tmp.</P></BODY>
