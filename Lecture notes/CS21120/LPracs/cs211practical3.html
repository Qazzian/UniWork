</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>The idea today is to practice some of the things we’ve been going over about recursive procedures. There’s lots of things you could do to achieve this. Pick and choose from the ideas below, but make sure that you understand the idea of recursion and can follow how it might work. (Writing your own recursive routines takes practice and a ‘recursive mindset’ but anyone should be able to read them.)</P>
<OL>

<LI>Take the code that we went over in class for factorial or fibonacci and put some print statements at the top of each routine so that you can see what happens with the recursive calls. For example you might print at the top of the factorial routine "now calculating the factorial of "+n</LI>
<LI>Look at the code I gave you for Towers of Hanoi (or look in Standish) and run it. Observe what happens with the recursive calls.</LI>
<LI>Look at my example in ~ltt/zzTeaching/mostlyJava/JavaVarious/Recursion. It uses a binary search from the java.util.Arrays class. Copy it into your own directory and make sure it works. Now replace the binary search with your own binary search that uses the recursive code I gave you in class. </LI>
<P>Make sure you are also aware of the non-recursive code for binary search.</P>
<P>Everyone should get to here during (or after) the practical.</P>
<LI>(trickier!) Write a recursive function that prints a linked list. Use the following algorithm:</LI>
<P>if the list is empty&#9;</P>
<P>print nothing</P>
<P>else</P>
<P>&#9;print the first element</P>
<P>&#9;print the rest of the list</P>
<LI>(trickier still!) Suppose you had a linked list of numbers. Write a recursive procedure for summing the list.</LI></OL>
