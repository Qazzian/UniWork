<h1>CS21120- Design, Data Structures and Algorithms - Introduction</h1>
<h2> 2000 - 2001</h2>

    In overview, some of the key areas we will deal with are:
<ul>    
    <li> Modern techniques for the detailed specification and design of programs.
    .. we will be covering:
    <ul>
    <li> Abstract Data Types designed/implemented in an Object Oriented fashion;

    <li> Methods of storing and retrieving large amounts of data; 
    <li> Methods of sorting large amounts of data; and 
    <li> Methods of representing complex relationships in data.
    </ul>
    <li> Analysis of algorithms 
    <ul>
    <li> How efficient is the code you write, and how can you improve algorithms so that they can run faster, and make more efficient use of the resources that are available?
</ul>
    <li> Designing and writing significant Java programs. 
    <ul>
    <li> One thing to remember is that just because the course language is Java, it does not mean that the techniques that we learn about are not applicable to other languages. 
    </ul>
    
</ul>    
    <h3> Why are Data Structures important?
    </h3>
    Although one might think that, as computers become cheaper, program efficiency becomes less important, this is not necessarily the case. More powerful computers encourage us to attempt more complex problems. More complex problems demand more computation, making the need to further consider efficiency.
   <p> 
    A data structure is simply a data representation and its associated operations. Viewed as a data representation, even an integer or floating point number stored on a computer is a simple data structure. More typically data structures are usually an organisation or structuring of data items. A sorted list of integers stored in an array is a simple example of structuring.
   <p> 
    In Java in addition to the basic primitive types such as integer, real, character and boolean we also have the much more powerful Object. However even with the constructs such as Array and Vector,
    we are still at a rather fundamental level. 
    <p>
   So, even with the powerful constructs available in Java, we will often want to represent, and reason about, other more complex information...
   
   If we are able to design better data structures, which map into the problems we want to solve, then it will be easier to write large, complex, and efficient programs.
         
    <h3> What is an algorithm? 
and why are they important?    </h3>
    "An algorithm is a clearly specified set of simple instructions to be followed to solve a problem".
    
<p>    
    Algorithms are very closely related to data structures. Why? Because mostly algorithms are reading from, altering and writing information back to a data structure (or combination of data structures).
<p>    
    It is very important that the algorithm is written in a way that efficiently uses the available resources.
<p>    
    Given sufficient space to store a collection of data items, it is always possible to search for specified items within the collection, process the data items in any desired order, or modify any particular value. However, the choice of data structure can make the difference between a program running in a few seconds and one requiring many days.
<p>    
    When we are given a problem to solve, we need to carefully analyse it to determine the performance goals that must be achieved. It is often the case that designers will simply apply a data structure that they are familiar with, even though it might be inappropriate for the task. The result is typically a slow program. Conversely it is no sense in adopting a complex representation to "improve" a program when it can adequately meet its performance requirements with a simpler solution.
<p>    
    A solution is said to be efficient if it solves the problem within the required resource constraints. These constraints will include memory, disk space and time. A solution may also be called efficient if it requires fewer resources than known alternatives.
    
<h3>    Choosing your data structure and algorithm
</h3>

    Follow these steps:
    <ol>
   <li> Analyse the problem to determine the resource constraints that any solution must meet.
   <li> Determine the basic operations that must be supported and quantify the resource constraints for each operation. Common questions are:
   <ul>
    <li> Insertion of items: at the beginning or interspersed with other operations?
    <li> Can data items be deleted
    <li> Searching: sequential or random access?
    
    </ul>
    <li> Select the data structure that best meets the requirements.
    </ol>
 
    
    Each data structure has associated <strong> costs and benefits.
    </strong> One cannot claim that one data structure is better than all others for use in all applications.
    A data structure requires a certain amount of space for each data item that it stores, a certain amount of time to perform a single basic operation, and a certain amount of programming effort. Each problem has constraints on space and time. Only after a careful analysis of the problem's characteristics can you determine the best data structure.
 <p>   
         
         For us to be able to pick the appropriate algorithm, we need to properly understand the problem, and the characteristics of the different kinds of solution. 
      
         There are many different <strong> trade-offs, </strong>
         two of which are:
  <ol>       
         <li> Time verses Space.  <br>
         
         How fast is the algorithm, and how much memory is required to obtain a solution. Often the fastest algorithms take the most memory.
         
         <li> Implementation effort verses Performance.  <br>
         
         Is it really worth the effort of making an algorithm run quickly? If a program is only to be used a few times, then optimising the code may not be worthwhile.
  </ol>       
         Also, we must remember that some problems are very difficult...it may not be possible to write an optimum solution in a reasonable time. In these cases, we should recognise the problem, and use techniques to find reasonably good solutions.
         
 <hr>
         
         In summary...
 <ul>        
         <li> Program design is important, and if it is done properly, it allows us to build large, complex programs that are both efficient and easy to maintain.
         
         <li> A good background of data structures is essential if you are to have a hope of solving some of the problems that you are likely to come across as software engineers.
         
         <li> It is very important that the algorithms you write or choose to solve a problem are efficient.
</ul>
