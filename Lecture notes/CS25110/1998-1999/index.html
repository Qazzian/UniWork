<LI> Workshops:
  <UL>
  2/2/99 Revision of IP (you will need this for the Prac experinents)
  </UL>
<LI> Practicals:
  <UL> The pracs will be held in the DSL Lab.  You will work in pairs,
  and in total there are three experiments to do.  
  Each experiment will take <em>one</em> 2 hour prac
  slot (probably on alternate weeks) and you will be expected 
  to write up each experiment.  Each student will thus spend a total of 6 
  hours in the lab plus some time producing the report accounting in total 
  for 10% of the marks for this course (10 credits = nominally 80 hours work). This work 
  will be handed in near the end of the semester. The pracs will not 
  start until 3-4
  weeks in to the course. 

<p>The report for the CS25110 practicals should be handed in between 2.30-3.30pm on
 friday 7th May. The style should be that of a scientific report. 
This implies it will be a clear, concise description of what was done,
 with a level of detail such that a reader of the report would be able 
to reproduce the experiment. You should include a summary of what was done 
and what was learned together any results (graphs etc), observations or 
analysis you made.  I would expect the write up of each experiment to 
require a maximum of 2-3 pages.
