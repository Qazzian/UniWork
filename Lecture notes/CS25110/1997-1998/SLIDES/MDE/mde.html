</H2>
<H3>
  1.1 WHAT IS MDE?.
</H3>
<P>
The concept of the 'Multifunctional Desktop Environment' was developed to
encompass the converging technologies of personal computing. personal
telecommunications and multi-function, multimedia applications.
<P>
The objective of the Multifunctional Desktop Environment concept is to provide
an architecture/model/blueprint for a workstation that provides its user
with a complete working environment where he/she can access, manipulate and
communicate information in a variety of mediums (text, image, audio and video).
<P>
In essence, the Multifunctional Desktop Environment (MDE) concept fulfils
a number of roles:
<UL>
  <LI>
    As an architecture, the MDE can be used to show how existing and emerging
    technology concepts fit into an overall infrastructure model.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    As an infrastructure model, the MDE can be used to identify the functions
    and services it would offer to its users.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    As a 'blueprint', the MDE can be used as the basis for constructing an actual
    MDE workstation.
</UL>
<H3>
  1.2 WHAT FUNCTIONS SHOULD THE MDE PROVIDE?
</H3>
<P>
The main sections of this document outline the user specification for the
MDE. The specification attempts to define the functional requirements from
an end user standpoint (rather than state the use of specific standards and
technologies).
<P>
Essentially, the MDE should provide the following:
<UL>
  <LI>
    It should support all the current personal productivity tools (eg. application
    packages such as word-processing, spreadsheets, graphic design tools etc.).
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    It should support interactive communication tools (eg. voice telephony, video
    telephony etc.). These should be available for both internal communication
    (within the company) and external communication (between the company and
    the outside world).
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    It should support collaborative working tools (eg. telex, fax, electronic
    mail etc), again allowing-both internal and external company communication.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    It should support a limited set of wide area network (WAN) connections (ie.
    basic rate and/or primary rate ISDN).
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    It should support a limited set of Local Area Network (LAN) connections
    (including Token Ring and Ethernet) to allow access to local LANs.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    It should support a limited set of LAN operating systems (including Netware
    and LAN Manger) to allow access to LAN services.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    It should support a limited set of transport protocols (such as TCP/IP) to
    allow communication to distributed Systems.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    It should support MDE to remote LAN connections (via ISDN).
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    It should support terminal emulation packages to allow access to corporate
    mainframe/mini computing facilities (eg support for protocol emulators simulating
    IBM 3270, DEC VT etc). Such packages could also be used to access external
    computer based services (such as public databases etc).
</UL>
<H3>
  1.3 WHERE WILL THE MDE BE USED?.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE is likely to be sited in one of the following environments:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Within a corporate site where it would have complete access to all the corporate
    IT infrastructure (eg. a connection to the site LAN, the site PABX, the corporate
    WAN etc).
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    At a smaller corporate location (eg. a small sales office, retail outlet
    etc), where access to the corporate IT infrastructure would be limited and
    probably only accessible via public network connections.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    At a location not owned by the company (eg an employees home, hotel, a customers
    premises etc). Here again, access to the corporate IT infrastructure would
    be limited to that available via public network connections.
</UL>
<P>
In practice, the physical location of the MDE will in most cases define the
level of service it would provide to its user.
<H3>
  1.4 WHAT ARE THE CONSTRAINTS ON THE MDE?.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE concept is intended to be a pragmatic solution for the personal working
environment of users in large corporations. From this viewpoint, a number
of constraints/statements can be stated regarding the MDE.
<H4>
  1.4.1 Large Corporate Requirements.
</H4>
<P>
The MDE was developed on the basis that it would meet the needs of the. majority
of users in large corporates. To this end, the MDE architecture focuses on
the technologies, products and vendors widely used by the large corporate
organisations. For example, the-personal. computing platforms that could
be used for the MDE workstation have been limited to those normally used
by the large corporates (ie. IBM PC, Apple Macintosh and Unix workstation).
Other computer platforms will not be included within this architecture. The
same limitation approach applies to the MDE's communications, applications
etc.
<H4>
  1.4.2 An Evolutionary Approach.
</H4>
<P>
The capital investment in existing technologies means that the implementation
of the MDE concept must be evolutionary rather than revolutionary, building
on existing platforms rather than requiring wholesale equipment replacement.
For this reason, the MDE workstation utilizes the existing personal computing
platforms and their associated multi-tasking operating Systems. In essence,
the functionality provided by the MDE is obtained by the 'add-on' hardware
and software components to existing computing platforms.
<P>
The MDE workstation would also have to make use of the most cost effective
communications available, the 'Integrated Services Digital Network' (ISDN)
in many cases being the ideal wide area solution through its provision of
fast call setup, high speed transmission, low error rates, flexible call
routing and usage dependent charging.
<H4>
  1.4.3 Pragmatic &amp; Deliverable.
</H4>
<P>
The MDE workstation must be something that is practical and that can be delivered
quickly (ie. within the next 12 months), therefore it will only encompass
technologies which either exist today, or that are likely to arrive within
the foreseeable future, and that are available in (at least.) across Western
Europe and North America.
<P>
This approach is necessary so as to allow large corporates to negotiate
customer/supplier contacts with a number of vendors (eg computer vendors,
public telecom operators, PABX vendors etc).
<H3>
  1.5 DEFINING AN MDE TERMINOLOGY.
</H3>
<P>
Given the abundant use of acronyms, synonyms and buzz words within the
Information Technology (IT) community, an important role of the MDE. architecture
is to define a set of associated terms and their meaning (these can be found
in Appendix C: MDE Terminology). 
  <HR>
<P>
<A HREF="#con">&lt;BACK TO TOP&gt;</A>
<H2>
  <A NAME="sec2"><U><B>SECTION 2: OVERVIEW OF THE MDE
  ARCHITECTURE.</B></U><B> </B></A>
</H2>
<H3>
  2.1 TODAYS DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT.
</H3>
<P>
Users of information technology (IT) today typically have an office desktop
which contains either an IBM compatible personal computer (running either
DOS, DOS/Windows or OS/2), a Macintosh, or a UNIX workstation. Such users
typically use several standalone application packages (ie Word-processing,
Spreadsheets, CAD/CAM, Publishing etc).
<P>
A growing number of user's have a Local Area Network (LAN) connection which
gives them access to file servers, print servers etc. Wide Area Network (WAN)
data communication is generally provided via' LAN/WAN gateways, although
many standalone computers have dial-up modem capability.
<P>
The only other common IT item on the desktop is the telephone, generally
used only for voice communication. This telephone will be connected either
directly to the public network or via a site telephone exchange.
<P>
The Multifunctional Desktop Environment concept was developed partly to describe
the above physical personal computing and telecommunications environment.
The-main emphasis behind the MDE however was to describe the convergence
of this physical infrastructure with the emerging multi-function, multimedia
applications. In essence, the MDE describes a complete working environment
where the user can access, manipulate and communicate information in a variety
of mediums (text-, image, audio and video).
<H3>
  2.2 OVERVIEW OF THE MDE ARCHITECTURE.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE can be encapsulated in a simple architectural model (shown in Figure
1). The MDE Model describes the main components of the MDE: the user interface;
applications/tools; computing platform and communications.
<H4>
  2.2.1 Graphical User Interface.
</H4>
<P>
At the top of the model is the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI is
the primary interface between the user and the MDE. The GUI presents information
in a multimedia format, combining one or more mediums such as text, graphics,
still image, animation and full-motion video, alongside audio sound.
<H4>
  2.2.2 User Applications/Tools.
</H4>
<P>
Below the GUI is the user's applications or 'Tools'. The HDE model divides
these tools into five main categories:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Personal Productivity Tools which covers all the users standalone applications
    (eg. word-processing, CAD tools, publishing);
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Interactive Communication Tools which provides the user with all his real-time
    communication services (eg. voice telephony);
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Collaborative Working Tools which covers applications which allows information
    to be communicated from the MDE workstation to other devices (eg. facsimile);
  <LI>
    Access to External Services which provides the user with access to applications
    and services which are not within the immediate MDE environment (eg. access
    to a printer on a local LAN, access to a remote host computer);
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Support Utilities are tools which provide some form of function or service
    to the above four categories (eg. document imaging which allows scanned documents
    to be input to applications such as word-processing).
</UL>
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
Figure 1 (below) shows where individual tools reside within the architectural
model.
<P>
<IMG SRC="paper5a.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">

<P>
<B>5</B>. <U>SUPPORT UTILITIES</U>: Document Imaging; Audio Manager; File
Transfer; Directory; Windows Manager. 
  <HR>
<H4>
  2.2.3 Computing Platform.
</H4>
<P>
The tools reside on a personal computing platform, which in the case of the
MDE architectural model is limited to three main hardware technologies and
four operating systems:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The IBM personal computer (or compatible) hardware with either DOS/Windows
    or 0S12 operating systems;
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    The Apple Macintosh; personal computer with the System 'n' operating system;
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    The High-end Workstation with the UNIX operating system.
</UL>
<H4>
  2.2.4 Communications.
</H4>
<P>
The bottom layer of the MDE architectural model describes the communications:
<P>
either a direct link from the personal computing platform to public/private
ISDN and/or a link to a LAN (either Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI or ATM) which
has a LAN/ISDN gateway. 
  <HR>
<P>
<A HREF="#con">&lt;BACK TO TOP&gt;</A>
<H2>
  <A NAME="sec3"><U><B>SECTION 3: PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY
  TOOLS</B></U><B>.</B></A>
</H2>
<P>
The Multifunctional Desktop Environment should support all existing personal
productivity tools. This would include packages such as word-processing,
spreadsheets, CAD/CAM, desktop publishing etc.
<P>
In addition, the HDE should support emerging personal productivity tools
which are focused more specifically towards the MDE environment. Such tools
include Multimedia Authoring and Electronic Documentation.
<H3>
  3.1 MULTIMEDIA AUTHORING.
</H3>
<P>
Multimedia Authoring packages allow the user to develop information presentation
objects that include text, still image, full-motion video, animation and
voice annotation.
<P>
Potential uses for such presentations include multimedia electronic documents,
multimedia mail etc.
<P>
Multimedia Authoring packages would obtain their raw information from other
application packages (for example, text produced by wordprocessors, still
image captured by Document Imaging systems, full-motion video from Video
Capture Systems etc).
<H3>
  3.2 ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTATION SYSTEMS.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support remote access to electronic
documentation databases. This system would allow the user to view electronically
stored books, manuals, word processed documents etc.
<H3>
  3.3 DOCUMENT IMAGING SYSTEMS.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support Document Imaging Systems. This
would provide the user with the facility to store, retrieve and manipulate
images captured via document scanners, video capture devices etc.
<P>
The Document Imaging System may also support text recognition allowing image
characters to be converted into word processable text. 
  <HR>
<P>
<A HREF="#con">&lt;BACK TO TOP&gt;</A>
<H2>
  <A NAME="sec4"><U><B>SECTION 4: INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION
  TOOLS</B></U><B>.</B></A>
</H2>
<P>
The Multi-functional Desktop Environment should support interactive, real-time
communication services. Such services would allow two or more people to
instantaneously communicate using any combination of voice, image, text and
full-motion video.
<P>
Interactive Communication currently comprises three main tools:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Voice Telephony.
  <LI>
    Desktop Conferencing.
  <LI>
    Video Telephony.
</OL>
<H3>
  4.1 VOICE TELEPHONY.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE architecture should include voice telephony as a mandatory service
requirement. As a minimum it should provide the user with all the features
currently associated with a standard telephone.
<P>
To support Voice Telephony, the MDE workstation would require the following
hardware/software features:
<H4>
  4.1.1 The Telephone Interface.
</H4>
<P>
The MDE workstation should have an integral telephone interface (ie. a handset
or speaker-phone. which is either physically part of the MDE workstation
and/or the provision of a telephone interface socket to allow the attachment
of an external device). The telephone interface should be digital in operation,
and optionally support 'hands. free' operation.
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally provide an analogue socket interface
(to allow connection of existing analogue handsets).
<H4>
  4.1.2 MDE Workstation to Network Connection.
</H4>
<P>
The MDE workstation should support a minimum of one ISDN basic rate digital
circuit connection (to allow connection to either a public or private ISDN).
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support analogue circuit connection
(to allow connection to either a private of public analogue network).
<H4>
  4.1.3 Telephony Signalling.
</H4>
<P>
The MDE workstation should support ISDN signalling protocols.
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support analogue signalling protocols.
<P>
The above hardware/software would provide the MDE workstation with additional
capabilities:
<H4>
  4.1.4 Audio Input Function.
</H4>
<P>
The telephone interface (handset or speaker-phone) could be used as the audio
input device to the MDE workstation (eg. it would allow audio input to voice
annotation applications, voicemail systems etc).
<H4>
  4.1.5 Telephone Directory Services.
</H4>
<P>
The integration of the MDE directory (see Section 7.4) with Voice
<P>
Telephony would allow the MDE workstation to manage outgoing calls and
<P>
identify incoming callers.
<H4>
  4.1.6 Computer Supported Telephony.
</H4>
<P>
The MDE workstation could support computer supported telephony applications
(ie. incoming calls could activate applications on the workstation).
<H3>
  4.2 DESKTOP CONFERENCING.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE architecture should include desktop conferencing as a mandatory service
requirement. Desktop Conferencing provides the ability for two or more people
to communicate interactively using audio voice and shared screen images (such
as word processed documents, spreadsheets, photographs etc).
<P>
Desktop Conferencing can be sub-divided into a number of functions, namely:
<H4>
  4.2.1 Shared Screen Images.
</H4>
<P>
Users can share the screen images amongst the people in the desktop conference.
The images could be created by any user package, with any changes to the
master image being quickly passed to the other users. The transmitted image
may be the whole screen, or selected windows within the screen.
<H4>
  4.2.2 Whiteboard.
</H4>
<P>
The screen could be used as a whiteboard, the writing implement being either
the mouse, a lightpen, stylus, keyboard etc. The whiteboard could also be
used to display scanned document images, still photos, video stills etc.
<H4>
  4.2.3 File Transfer.
</H4>
<P>
Desktop Conferencing users should have a file transfer option to allow one-to-one
or one-to-many real-time file transfer (this function may be provided by
the file transfer utility within the Support Utility. Tools -see Section
7.1.3).
<H4>
  4.2.4 Audio Voice.
</H4>
<P>
The audio voice within desktop conferencing should be provided by the voice
telephony tool (see Section 4.1).
<P>
Desktop Conferencing should conform to a set of international standards (yet
to be defined).
<P>
Desktop Conferencing should support additional standards to allow for the
integration and/or interworking between desktop conferencing and video telephony.
<H3>
  4.3 VIDEO TELEPHONY.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE architecture should optionally support video telephony. Video Telephony
will provide the user with full-motion video and audio communication to other
video telephony devices, video conferencing studios, video mail systems etc.
<P>
Video Telephony should conform to the emerging international standards for
interactive, full-motion video and audio communication (ie. CCITT H.320).
  <HR>
<P>
<A HREF="#con">&lt;BACK TO TOP&gt;</A>
<H2>
  <A NAME="sec5"><U><B>SECTION 5: COLLABORATIVE WORKING TOOLS.</B></U><B>
  </B></A>
</H2>
<P>
The Multifunctional Desktop Environment should support collaborative working
tools. Such tools basically allow information to be rapidly communicated
between specific locations or devices (as opposed to interactive communication
tools which allow real-time communication between individuals).
<P>
Collaborative Working tools therefore include telex, facsimile, electronic
mail, voicemail, videomail and groupware.
<P>
The MDE workstation should be able to communicate to other MDE workstations
as well as existing fax machines, telex machines, electronic mail services
etc.
<H3>
  5.1 TELEX.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support a telex interface (either
internally using a telex card/software package or via a link to a telex server).
<H3>
  5.2 FACSIMILE.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support both Group 3 and Group 4 facsimile
(either internally using a facsimile card/software package or via a link
to a fax server).
<H3>
  5.3 ELECTRONIC MAIL.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support electronic mail applications,
including compound documents and multimedia mail.
<P>
The workstation should be able to create, transmit, receive and display any
form of electronic document/mail. This includes documents/mail containing
voice, text, image or full-motion video.
<H3>
  5.4 VOICE MAIL.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support voicemail (either as an internal
application or via a link to a voicemail server).
<H3>
  5.5 VIDEOMAIL.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support videomail (either as an internal
application or via a link to a videomail server/VCR).
<H3>
  5.6 GROUPWARE.
</H3>
<P>
Groupware enables dispersed groups of people to work as a single unified
team (through access to shared information databases).
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support groupware applications.
<H3>
  5.7 ELECTRONIC DIARY.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support electronic diary Systems which
allow the co-ordination of personal diaries amongst groups of people. 
  <HR>

<H2>
  <U><B><A NAME="sec6">SECTION 6: ACCESS TO EXTERNAL
  SERVICES</A></B></U><B> </B>
</H2>
<P>
The Multifunctional Desktop Environment requires access to a range of external
services which are located outside its own immediate environment. Such services
could be located locally within an office/building (ie. LAN based services
such as file servers, printers etc), or alternatively the external services
could be located on the other side of the world (ie. mainframe databases,
remote PABXs etc).
<P>
Most large corporate user organisations use IBM, DEC or UNIX hosts, therefore
specific reference to these products are made within this section. This does
not mean the MDE architecture specifically excludes any other manufacturers
host product, but rather that the architecture is attempting to address most
large corporate requirements within the minimum possible number of proprietary
products and protocols.
<H3>
  6.1 ACCESS TO IBM MAINFRAME SERVICES.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support access to local and remote
IBM mainframes (see Figure 2 at end of section). Access should be provided
both at the physical connection and terminal emulation levels.
<P>
The MDE workstation should be able to physically connect via cluster controllers
Token Ring LANs and FEPs. The host machine may be either local (requiring
the MDE workstation to support local interface mechanisms) or. remote (via
ISDN links).
<P>
The MDE workstation should also support terminal emulation packages (eg.
IBM 3270 emulators).
<P>

<H3>
  6.2 ACCESS TO DEC MINI SERVICES.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support access to local and remote
DEC
<P>
VAXs (both physical connection and terminal emulation).
<P>
The MDE workstation should be able to physically connect via direct VAX
interfaces or Ethernet. The host machine may be either local (requiring the
MDE workstation to support local interface mechanisms) or remote (via ISDN
links).
<P>
The MDE workstation should also support terminal emulation packages (eg.VT
emulation).
<H3>
  6.3 ACCESS TO UNIX SERVICES.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should optionally support access to local and remote
UNIX machines.
<P>
The MDE workstation should be able to physically connect via direct connections
or via LANs. The host machine may be either local (requiring the MDE workstation
to support local interface mechanisms) or remote (via ISDN links).
<H3>
  6.4 ACCESS TO LOCAL/REMOTE LAN SERVICES.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should support access to local and remote LANs (see Figure
3 below). LAN technologies to be supported are Token Ring, Ethernet, FDDI
and ATM.
<P>
The MDE workstation should be able to physically connect via local interface
mechanisms or remotely via ISDN links.
<H3>
  6.5 ACCESS TO REMOTE MDE WORKSTATIONS.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should be able to access a remote MDE workstation via
ISDN links (see Figure 4). The keyboard and screen of the local workstation
should then be able to operate the processor of the remote machine (this
functionality would be particularly useful for someone with a portable MDE
workstation who is working away from the office but requiring access to desktop
machine).
<P>
Due to obvious technical constraints, this functionality may be limited in
the short/medium term to MDE workstations based on identical platforms/operating
systems (ie. between two PC's using Windows rather than between a PC and
a Macintosh).
<H3>
  6.6 ACCESS BETWEEN MDE WORKSTATIONS ON LANs.
</H3>
<P>
A LAN based MDE workstation should be able to access a remote LAN based MDE
workstation via LAN-to-LAN interconnection over ISDN (see Figure 5).
<H3>
  6.7 ACCESS TO MDE WORKSTATIONS ON LANs.
</H3>
<P>
The MDE workstation should be able to access a remote LAN based MDE workstation
via ISDN (see figure 5 below).

  FACTORS.</B></U><B> </B></A>
</H2>
<H3>
  8.1 SUPPORT COMPONENTS.
</H3>
<P>
Figure 6 (below) outlines a number of hardware/software components which
although outside the MDE architecture provide an MDE workstation with essential
services.
<H4>
  8.1.1 Multimedia Graphical User Interface.
</H4>
<P>
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) must be capable of supporting Multimedia
information. For Microsoft, it is Windows 3.1 Multimedia Extensions. For
IBM, OS/2 2.0 Multimedia Extensions. Also the X Windows System and Quicktime.
<H4>
  8.1.2 Application Programming Interface.
</H4>
<P>
The MDE workstation requires as a minimum a common application programming
interface (API) to allow any ISDN application to interwork with any suitable
ISDN card.
<P>
Ideally, the API should allow any communications oriented application to
interwork with any communications card (be it ISDN Token Ring, Ethernet etc)
via a common API.
<H4>
  8.1.3 MDE/ISDN Interface.
</H4>
<P>
The MDE workstation should support a common network interface so that the
workstation could operate on any ISDN in any country. This assumes therefore
that all ISDN user/network interfaces comply to a common standard.
<H4>
  8.1.4 ISDN/LAN Interface.
</H4>
<P>
As with 8.1.3 above, the LAN to ISDN user/network interface should conform
to a common standard on all ISDNs.
<H3>
  8.2 EXTERNAL INFLUENCING FACTORS.
</H3>
<P>
Figure 7 outlines a number of areas which although outside the MDE architecture,
are an essential requirement for MDE workstation development.
<P>
In summary, these areas are International Standards; Conformance Testing,
Interoperability Testing; and Management &amp; Security.

  PLATFORM</A></B></U><B> </B>
</H2>
<P>
The following section details the three main computing platforms to be used
by an MDE workstation.
<H3>
  A.1 THE IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER PLATFORM.
</H3>
<P>
The IBM Personal Computer (or compatible) variant of the MDE would require
the following minimum configuration:
<UL>
  <LI>
    A 80486 processor.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    A minimum of 4 Mbytes of memory.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    VGA colour screen, capable of supporting a minimum of 256 colours.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Have access to fixed disc drive capacity of at least 100 Mbytes.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    DOS/Windows, OS/2, or UNIX Operating System.
</UL>
<H3>
  A.2 THE APPLE MACINTOSH COMPUTING PLATFORM.
</H3>
<P>
The Apple Macintosh Computer variant of the HDE would require the following
minimum configuration:
<UL>
  <LI>
    A Motorola 68000 series processor.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    5 Mbytes of memory.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    A colour screen of 1 million pixels capable of supporting a minimum of 256
    colours.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Have access to fixed disc drive capacity of at least 160 Mbytes.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    System 7 operating system.
</UL>
<H3>
  A.3 THE UNIX WORKSTATION COMPUTING PLATFORM.
</H3>
<P>
It is expected that the MI)E could be hosted on any of the current popular
UNIX workstations. A typical UNIX variant of the HDE would require the following
minimum configuration:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The processor could be from any of the major manufacturers. The processors
    SPARC, ALPHA, HIPS and both RISC and CISC processors of Motorola or Intel
    are all suitable. Other powerful processors should prove sufficient too.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    The memory required is likely to be at least 8 Mbytes with 16 Mbytes or more
    being the ideal.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    A colour screen with 1 million pixels, each capable of being set to one of
    256 colours is necessary.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    The disc space requirement is likely to be influenced by the underlying operating
    system than by the presence of the HDE. The MDE will probably add around
    50 Mbytes to the requirement. This may be supplied on the local hard disc
    or from a fileserver accessed over a LAN.
</UL>
<P>
UNIX System V or OSF/l are likely to be the operating systems. The X Window
System will also be required with either the Openlook or MOTIF look and feel.

</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    A standardised API between the card and user application.
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    A physical connector to support a digital telephone handset and optionally
    a physical connector for an analogue handset.
