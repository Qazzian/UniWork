<P>parity is used for error detection and will be discussed later</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>since we have equal length code this implies each symbol should have equal probability for efficient information representation -which is probably not true, but is dependent on the type of information represented</P>
<P></P>
<P>compare English, French, or a JAVA program source file</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>Hence normally the amount of data will actually take more space than its strict information content would require</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>In 8 bit ASCII some possible codes are never used - and even though they may never be transmitted their very existence reduces the efficiency of the code ! </P>
<P></P>
<P>why ? because the codes that are used are longer on average</P>
