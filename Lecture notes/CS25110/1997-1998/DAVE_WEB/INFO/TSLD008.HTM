<P><UL><LI>Redundancy exists when information content is less than data content.<LI>Lossless encoding or compression seeks to reduce redundancy by making the data rate closer to the information content.<LI>Data sources often produce lots of data<LI>Sometimes in an application not all of the “information” is of interest.<LI>We can throw away this unwanted information to further improve transmission performance.<LI>These type of coding strategies are known as lossey.</UL></P>

<P>lossless encoding is completely reversible..</P>

<P>information here is used not in the strict mathematical sense, but from the point of view of a specific task.  How often do we get information which is surplus to requirements ? </P>
<P></P>
<P>e.g.. I never read the sports results in the paper</P>

<P>The simplest idea is not to transmit certain parts of the data. I do not need hi fi quality (20khz) sound only phone.  4khz is adequate so the amount of information is reduced by filtering- fairly easy  in the analogue domain because physics ‘naturally’ takes care of the reduction of high frequency components (unrequired  information content) or quality reduction.  Not always so easy in the digital domain...</P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>here we are considering the context of the data usage</P>
<P></P>
<P>For instance, in a web application we might reduce information -> bandwidth - by making a less sharp image-no good to simply show top 1/4 of the image !</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>There are ways of filtering large digital datasets such as images to reduce the data rate.  We can even take out information which is captured by a camera but not visible to the eye ! - to us this is useless information
