<P>note that independent is a term from statistics, for our purposes simply think of it as meaning there is no relationship between one event and the next.  </P>

<P>e.g. events “raining” and “put up umbrella” may be correlated so given information that one has occurred (i.e. it is raining) may affect our ability to predict the second.</P>

<P>the “b” in the formula determines unit of information, i.e. b=2 provides “bits” worth of information</P>
