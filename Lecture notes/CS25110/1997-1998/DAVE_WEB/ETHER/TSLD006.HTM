<P>In general 4 types of service primitives between ANY two layers:</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>Request - requect a service</P>
<P></P>
<P>Indication significant event to higher layer possibly detection of a requect.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Response- may occur as a reply to indication</P>
<P></P>
<P>Confirm - results  of last request</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>only unacknowledged connectionless provided by CSMA/CD so only request and indication services provided.</P>
<P></P>
<P>no response is provided by reciever (good for broadcast !)</P>
<P></P>
<P>no confirmation of arrival of data is possible</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>LLC has several classes of service, but onle type 1 is supported by CSMA/CD- type 1 only provides  two primitives to the network layer.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>For other physical level protocols more classes of service might be possible - then the LLC can provide more services to the network layer. eg confirmations for connection oriented services.</P>
