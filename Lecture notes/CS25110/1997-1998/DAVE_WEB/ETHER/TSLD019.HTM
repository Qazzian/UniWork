<P><H2>All access to the 802.3 LAN only completes with some probability.  It is thus impossible to guarantee transfer rates. When the net is very busy collisions might go on forever !</H2>

<H2>Real Time Use</H2>
<H2></H2>
<H2>Debates often take place on the usability of CSMA/CD LANs for real time use.  The answer depends on the true use intended rather than the LAN.

<P>if load is strictly controlled then we can get specific delay and transfer times to a high degree of probability - but not guaranteed.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>the robot example:</P>
<P></P>
<P>if control strategy is keep moving till you are told to stop then a disaster might occur.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>if however the robot only keeps moving if it keeps getting messaged then we are fail safe in the “unlikely” event of a delay.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>Slotted systems such as Cambridge ring can guarantee delivery delay and rates but at the expense of wasted bandwidth if the traffic is not constant.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>CSMA/CD good for bursty traffic...</P>

<P>Question: think of other suitable/unsuitable applications
