<hr><h1>CS35210 (1999-00 session)<br>Implementing the Information Society</h1><hr>
<h2>Brief Description</h2>    
<p>
      Recent advances in Computing and Telecommunications
      technologies are leading to dramatic changes in society and at
      home. There is general consensus about an information revolution
      and the arrival of an Information Society. This module will
      study issues related to this new information society. The module
      may prove of interest to students outside the Computer Science
      department. This module should not be confused with IL31310
      (Information and Society) which is primarily aimed at
      professional Information Scientists.

<A NAME="aimsanchor"><h2>Aims</h2></a>The module aims to introduce students to a wide range of
    issues related to the coming of an information society. The module
    will study the history of developments which pave the way for the
    information society, the changes which are starting to occur in
    society, the economy and the home and the issues which need to be
    addressed in the future.
  
<A NAME="objectivesanchor"><h2>Objectives</h2></a>At the end of the module, the students will have developed a critical
        appreciation of:
 
<ul>
<li>
the developments which are leading to the arrival of the Information Society;
<li>
the changes that are expected to occur in education,
            commerce, working practices and general society;
</ul>

     When implementing IS applications they will be able to take proper
     account of:
 
<ul>
<li>
the legal implications of an information society;
<li>
the constraints imposed by telecommunications regulation;
<li>
issues being currently addressed by researchers.
</ul>
