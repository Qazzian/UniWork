<hr><h1>CS38010 (1999-00 session)<br>Professional Issues in Software Engineering</h1><hr>
<h2>Brief Description</h2>This module covers a range of non-technical issues - legal,
    financial,  managerial and organisational -  with which a
    professional software engineer should be familiar.  Although  the
    topics are applicable  more widely than simply to software
    engineering, they are taught in that  context.  The module is not
    therefore suitable for students from other disciplines. The module
    is an  obligatory part of the BEng  and MEng degree schemes in
    Software Engineering and of the BSc schemes in  Computer Science
    and  Computer Science with a European Language.
