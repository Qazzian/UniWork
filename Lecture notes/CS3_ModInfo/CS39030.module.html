<hr><h1>CS39030 (1999-00 session)<br>Major Project</h1><hr>
<h2>Brief Description</h2>Students must complete a substantial piece of work, under the
    direction of a supervisor but involving self discipline,
    organisation and initiative. The projects typically involve
    developing a piece of software from an initial statement of
    requirements through specification and design stages, to
    successful implementation and testing. For students with a
    suitable background the project may contain a hardware element. A
    list of suggested projects is maintained by the third year
    co-ordinator. Projects are normally chosen from this list but we
    welcome students' own suggestions, especially those arising from
    industrial year experience.

The
    resit assessment will also be a major piece of project work.

A mark of at
      least 40% in CS39030 is required for an honours degree.

<A NAME="aimsanchor"><h2>Aims</h2></a>Single Honours Computer Science and BEng students are required
    to do a  30 credit major project as part of their undergraduate
    experience. 
<p>
 (Joint Honours students are not normally
      encouraged to do a  CS39030 project, as opposed to a
      
<A HREF="CS39110.module.html">CS39110</A>
 project because this would leave them short of
      taught modules.) 
<p>
 The purpose of the CS39030 project is
      to give students the opportunity to bring together the practical
      skills and theoretical understanding that they have acquired, by
      developing a complete product from the stage of specifying
      requirements through to demonstrating that the product does
      indeed satisfy those requirements. This process involves
      producing appropriate documentation, including documentation of
      the design decisions made.
  
<A NAME="objectivesanchor"><h2>Objectives</h2></a>The objectives of this course are for the student to complete
    a substantial piece of work, under the direction of a supervisor
    but demonstrating self discipline, organisation and initiative.
    
<p>
 The projects typically involve developing a piece of software
      from an initial statement of requirements through specification
      and design stages, to successful implementation and testing,
      although some may include a hardware element (for students with
      a suitable background). 
<p>
 A list of suggested projects is
      maintained by the third year co-ordinator. Projects are normally
      chosen from this list but we welcome students' own suggestions,
      especially those arising from industrial year experience.
    
<A NAME="syllabusanchor"><h2>Syllabus</h2></a>
<dl>
<dt>
Formal Lectures - <em>2 Lectures</em><dd>
There are a small number of formal lectures associated
	with the project.
<dt>
Written	Material - <dd>
Various written material giving guidance on carrying out
	the project, assessment issues, and the project submission is
	provided by the department. Students are expected to spend
	perhaps ten hours in an average week on the project and to see
	their supervisor once a week. This course is assessed on the
	written report submitted by the student. Reports must be
	submitted by the end of the first week in May. Students will
	also be required to give a presentation of their project in
	the form of a seminar, which will account for 10% of
	the assessment.
