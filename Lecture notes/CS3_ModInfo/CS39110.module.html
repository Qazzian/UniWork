<hr><h1>CS39110 (1999-00 session)<br>Minor Project</h1><hr>
<h2>Brief Description</h2>This module is intended for joint honours students who wish to
    undertake project work as part of their final year course and for
    M.Eng. students upon returning from their industrial year. All
    details are like

, except that the effort expected
    is less. It has proved possible in the past for joint honours
    students to undertake a project carrying more credit by finding a
    topic which includes elements from both computing and their other
    discipline; the resulting mark is then split appropriately between
    the two components of their degree. The Computer Science
    department encourages joint honours students to undertake such
    projects.

<A NAME="aimsanchor"><h2>Aims</h2></a>This module is intended for joint honours students who wish to
    undertake project work as part of their final year course and for
    M.Eng. students upon returning from their industrial year. All
    details are like CS39030, except that the amount of effort
    expected is only about three hours a week. 
<p>
It has proved
      possible in the past for joint honours students to undertake a
      project equivalent to more than 10 credits by finding a topic
      which includes elements from both computing and their other
      discipline; the resulting mark is then split between the two
      components of their degree, counting for the equivalent of 10
      credits in each component. The Computer Science department
      encourages joint honours students to undertake such
      projects. 
<p>
M.Eng. students undertake a centrally organised
      project which complements their third year studies
<A NAME="objectivesanchor"><h2>Objectives</h2></a>The objectives of this course are for the student to complete
    a substantial piece of work, under the direction of a supervisor
    but involving self discipline, organisation and initiative. 
<p>
      The projects typically involve developing a piece of software
      from an initial statement of requirements through specification
      and design stages, to successful implementation and testing,
      although some may include a hardware element (for students with
      a suitable background). 
<p>
 A list of suggested projects is
      maintained by the third year co-ordinator. Joint honours students
      normally choose their projects from this list but we welcome students' own
      suggestions, especially those arising from the other component of the
      student's degree scheme. For M.Eng. students the project is selected
      by the M.Eng. third year coordinator.

<dt>
Formal Lectures - <em>2 Lectures</em><dd>
There are a small number of formal lectures
      associated with the project.
<dt>
Written	Material - <dd>
      Various written material giving guidance on
	carrying out the project, assessment issues, and the project
	submission is provided by the department. Students are
	expected to spend perhaps three hours in an average week on
	the project and to see their supervisor regularly. This course
	is assessed on the written report submitted by the student.
	Reports must be submitted by the end of the first week in May.
	Students will also be required to give a presentation of their
	project in the form of a seminar, which will account for
	10% of the assessment.
