<hr><h1>CS38410 (1999-00 session)<br>Management in Computing</h1><hr>
<h2>Brief Description</h2>Management in computing has many different facets.
    Operations management, project management,  and management of IT
    services are just three of many.  The different facets have many
    features in  common, however, such as the need for skills in
    strategic planning, budgeting, technical audit, and the
    management of technological change.  In this module, a treatment
    of these common skills and an  outline of management theory are
    used to provide an integrated treatment of the various facets of
    management in computing.

<A NAME="aimsanchor"><h2>Aims</h2></a>The primary aim of this module is to give students an
    understanding of the differing roles of  management in the various
    aspects of computing and of the skills required to carry out these
    roles  successfully.  This understanding should be underpinned by
    an appreciation of management theory.
  
<A NAME="objectivesanchor"><h2>Objectives</h2></a>On successful completion of this module, students should:
<ul>
<li>
understand the management roles involved in providing and
	maintaining an up-to-date IT service that  meets the needs of
	its users effectively and economically;
<li>
understand the skills necessary to carry out these roles
	effectively and be capable of exercising some of  those skills
	in a junior capacity;
<li>
be familiar with the basic ideas of management theory and
	appreciate how those ideas can help the  manager in
	practice.
