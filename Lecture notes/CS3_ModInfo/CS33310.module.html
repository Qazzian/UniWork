<hr><h1>CS33310 (1999-00 session)<br>Formal Methods in Software Engineering</h1><hr>
<h2>Brief Description</h2>The
    module introduces students to the use of mathematically formal
    methods for the specification of software. As background to the
    formal methods in software engineering, students are introduced to
    formal logic and some of its other applications in Computer
    Science.

<A NAME="aimsanchor"><h2>Aims</h2></a>This module aims to introduce students to the use of formal
    methods in software specification.  It develops the underlying
    ideas by presenting mathematical logic in a formal way,
    illustrating a number of different logics, and by showing some of
    the other applications of logic in Computer Science.
  
<A NAME="objectivesanchor"><h2>Objectives</h2></a>On successful completion of this course students should
    understand:
<ul>
<li>
the problems of incompleteness, inconsistency and
	ambiguity arising from traditional methods of software
	specification;
<li>
the different approaches to formal specification;
<li>
the nature of formal proof in the propositional and
	predicate logics;
<li>
the stages and processes involved in the development of a
	software design using VDM;
<li>
the need for the three valued logic of partial functions
	and how to carry out formal proof in that logic;
<li>
the ideas behind correctness proofs of computer code and
	how to carry out such proofs themselves;
<li>
how proof is applied to the data types of VDM;
<li>
the deficiencies of VDM and the attempts to overcome these
	in some other formal specification methods;
<li>
temporal logic and its application to the specification of
	concurrent systems;
<li>
the applications of logic in resolution theorem proving,
	logic programming, expert systems, and fuzzy systems.
</ul>
