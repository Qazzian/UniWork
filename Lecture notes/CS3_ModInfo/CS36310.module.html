<hr><h1>CS36310 (1999-00 session)<br>Artificial Intelligence Systems</h1><hr>
<h2>Brief Description</h2>This module concentrates on the technology and methodology of
    Artificial  Intelligence practice, in particular, programming
    languages  and software systems. The aim is to build on the
    concepts introduced in  
<A HREF="CS26210.module.html">CS26210</A>
 and show how
    knowledge-based systems can be implemented, developed  and
    evaluated.

<A NAME="aimsanchor"><h2>Aims</h2></a>    
<p>
This course will provide a good understanding of a variety of AI
      systems from machine learning to
      expert systems. This will enable students to gain an
      understanding of the current state of the art in applied AI systems.
  
<A NAME="objectivesanchor"><h2>Objectives</h2></a>On successful completion of this module students should:
    
<ul>
<li>
understand the differences between the main  classes of
	application oriented intelligent system, including
	representation and reasoning facilitites, and  performance
	issues;
<li>
understand the issues involved in constructing effective
	diagnostic systems
<li>
appreciate the problem of software engineering for
	intelligent systems;
<li>
have familiarity with current machine learning and data mining techniques and tools
</ul>

<dt>
Effective Diagnostic Expert Systems - <em>3 Lectures</em><dd>
Building on CS36210, these lectures will introduce how to
      build effective diagnostic systems for man made systems. It will
      therefore look at diagnostic trees, diagnostic test benches and issues
      associated with diagnostic systems.From these lectures the student
      should gain an understanding of the features of commercial expert
      systems tools and their strengths and limitations.
<dt>
Case based reasoning - <em>2 Lectures</em><dd>
These lectures will provide the student with an
	understanding of the techniques  which comprise a case-based
	reasoning (CBR) system. They should also gain an understanding
	of their strengths and weaknesses for diagnostic applications
	as well as when to apply and when not to apply CBR. The
	lectures will consider the basic structure of a CBR system and
	the use of a case base, representation and indexing of cases,
	case retrieval and adaptation and finally case repair.
<dt>
Model-based Reasoning - <em>3 Lectures</em><dd>
In these lectures "Functional" model based reasoning will
	be introduced. How a functional model-based system can be
	constructed and the problems and issues associated with such a
	task will be considered. In addition a functional model-based
	system constructed for Engineers will be considered in detail.
	This case study will highlight the trade offs which had to be
	made between ease of use and flexibility, power, etc.
<dt>
MBR for	Failure Mode Effect Analysis - <em>2 Lectures</em><dd>
These lectures will look at how MBR can be used as the
	basis of a design analysis system which can be used to provide
	information necessary for the construction of diagnostic
	systems.
<dt>
Neural Networks - <em>3 Lectures</em><dd>
These lectures will introduce the concepts behind Neural
	Networks and investigate some of the more important and useful
	neural network architectures. They will also aim to give an
	appreciation of the application of neural computing in
	industry.
<dt>
Machine	Induction - <em>3 Lectures</em><dd>
There are a large number of applications which exploit
	the approach to machine learning known as induction. In these
	lectures we will consider the application pf these methods.
      
<dt>
Inductive Logic
	Programming - <em>2 Lectures</em><dd>
Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a new and exciting
	development in AI systems which has a wide range of
	applications. These lectures will introduce ILP and the issues
	associated with applying ILP to real world problems.
<dt>
 Data Mining - <em>2 Lectures</em>, <em>1 Practical</em><dd>
Data mining has become one of the fastest growing
	application areas in AI. It combines various AI techniques
	such as neural networks and machine induction with statistical
	analysis and database techniques. A commercial Data Mining
	tool "Clementine" will be considered during these
	lectures.
