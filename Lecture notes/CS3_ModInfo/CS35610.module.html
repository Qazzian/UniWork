<A NAME="aimsanchor"><h2>Aims</h2></a>    This module builds on the base provided by CS15210 or CS14020,
    extending the students' knowledge of communications technologies.
    In particular, Ethernet will be studied in detail as an example of
    a typical local area network.  Integrated Services Digital Network
    technology will also be considered in detail to provide an example
    of a wide area publicly available technology supporting a variety
    of services. The module will also provide insights into the
    concepts and protocols which underly newer fiber optic based fast
    technologies such as Cell and Frame relay networks.
  
<A NAME="objectivesanchor"><h2>Objectives</h2></a>    On successful completion of th emodule,  students will be able to:
    
<ul>
<li>
describe the progress made in the standards creation world in these topics;
<li>
apply methods used for the coding of information;
<li>
describe the components used to construct an Ethernet
	including  fast Ethernet and demonstrate an appreciation of
	the operation and  relationships of the protocols
	involved;
<li>
describe the technology and services provided by ISDN and Broadband ISDN networks;
<li>
describe the evolution and technical characteristics of high 
	speed communications technologies;
<li>
appreciate the issues involved in the planning and
	management of networks.
</ul>
