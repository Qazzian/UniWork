<hr><h1>CS31010 (1999-00 session)<br>Object-Oriented Programming and Design</h1><hr>
<h2>Brief Description</h2>    A major development in software design in the last
    decade has been the adoption of object-oriented techniques. The
    object approach first made an impact in the area of programming
    language design. The ideas have rapidly spread and
    object-oriented techniques are now of growing importance in areas
    as diverse as software design methods, databases, graphical user
    interfaces and distributed systems. In this module an
    introduction to the key concepts and features of object
    technology is provided. Students will learn object-oriented analysis and
    design and will implement object-oriented programs in Java, a
    modern object-oriented programming language.

<A NAME="aimsanchor"><h2>Aims</h2></a>    The aim of this course is to provide an outline of the key
    features of object-oriented technology. The course has a practical
    rather than theoretical emphasis: students will learn
    object-oriented design techniques by building object-oriented
    programs using a modern object-oriented programming language
    (Java). As well as lectures, the course will use practicals and
    web-based learning material.
  
<A NAME="objectivesanchor"><h2>Objectives</h2></a>On successful completion of this module, students should:
    
<ul>
<li>
understand the basic concepts of object technology;
<li>
be familiar with a standard object-orientated modelling
	notation;
<li>
have an appreciation of object-oriented analysis and
	design methods;
<li>
have a working knowledge of an object-oriented programming
	language.
</ul>
<A NAME="syllabusanchor"><h2>Syllabus</h2></a>
<dl>
<dt>
Introduction to Object Orientation - <em>3 Lectures</em><dd>
	These lectures introduce the basic concepts of object
	orientation, such as class, inheritance, method, instance,
	polymorhism and abstraction. They will also attempt to
	highlight the difference between an object oriented approach
	and a procedural approach to software development. Where
	appropriate comparisons with Ada and the approach it takes
	will be made.
      
<dt>
Introduction to the Java Language - <em>1 Lecture</em><dd>
	This will look at its history, its pedigree
	and explain the difference between applications and applets.
      
<dt>
Basic Java - <em>2 Lectures</em>, <em>2 Practicals</em><dd>
	These lectures and practicals will introduce the basics of the
	language such as class definitions, control structures, keywords,
	interface specifications etc. They will also look at some
	example applications.
      
<dt>
The Java Class library - <em>1 Lecture</em>, <em>2 Practicals</em><dd>
	In these lectures and practicals the important classes (such as
	Vector, HashTable, Array and Observable) and their uses will be
	discussed. The Java package concept will also be introduced.
      
<dt>
The Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) - <em>2 Lectures</em>, <em>1 Practical</em><dd>
	The major elements of the AWT will be introduced as
	well as the motivation for the AWT.
      
<dt>
Object oriented analysis and design - <em>1 Lecture</em><dd>
	This lecture will introduce the object oriented analysis and
	design process and will briefly consider existing
	methodologies and the approach taken in this module.
      
<dt>
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) - <em>1 Lecture</em><dd>
	The UML is an attempt by Booch, Rumbaugh and Jacobson
	to produce a common language for describing OO designs. This
	lecture will provide an overview of the UML.
      
<dt>
Use Case Modelling - <em>1 Lecture</em>, <em>1 Practical</em><dd>
	This lecture will describe Use Case Modelling; both
	methodological steps and the use of the UML notation.
      
<dt>
The Object Modeling Technique (OMT) - <em>6 Lectures</em>, <em>4 Practicals</em><dd>
	In these lectures the OMT approach to object oriented
	analysis and design will be considered. The analysis phase
	will be discussed in detail. The UML will be used to provide
	the modelling notation.
