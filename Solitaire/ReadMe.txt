1. Introduction

	1.1	Game Description
	
		Six Stack is a simple card game for one player. The idea is to remove all the cards 
		from the main body of the game by placing them on top of the discard pile. Of 
		course to make it a little more difficult the cards have to be + or -1 in value to 
		the card on top of the pile.
		
		This game was created as an assignment for part of my degree course at the 
		University of Wales, Aberystwyth. The object was to show that we (as students) 
		understand the concepts and uses of stacks and that we could use them in an 
		appropriate manner. If you really want to know more email me and I can get you a 
		report of the assignment.

		
	1.2 System Requirments
	
		Java Vertual Machine (JVM) must be installed on your computer.
		Will work on any Operating system
		
	1.3 File Contents
	
		A List of the contents of SixStack.zip
		ReadMe.txt		The file you are reading now.
		
		SixStack.bat	Will run SixStack from a UWA Computer.
		
		*.Class			The binary files which are run by the JVM.
		
		*.java			The Java source files for SixStack.
		
		SixStack.java	The Rule base and layout for the game. 
							This should be used by a user interface but contains it's own 
							interface for testing purposes.
							
		Pack.java		Defines a Pack of cards. Contains the code for creating a standard 
							Pack of 52 cards plus any number of Jokers
